0:00:03.740,0:00:09.780
hey welcome to the connecting with code

0:00:06.569,0:00:12.480
camp this video is just for the adults

0:00:09.780,0:00:14.670
right so some things to come we play the

0:00:12.480,0:00:16.199
background the camp are not exciting and

0:00:14.670,0:00:17.789
don't don't have the kids join me for

0:00:16.199,0:00:18.930
this one just the adults watch this and

0:00:17.789,0:00:21.449
so you kind of know what's up

0:00:18.930,0:00:23.970
so I'm Dave Fisher I'm a college

0:00:21.449,0:00:26.910
professor at rolls Holman every summer

0:00:23.970,0:00:28.199
we offer a connecting with code camp the

0:00:26.910,0:00:31.320
idea of this camp is it's really

0:00:28.199,0:00:32.759
targeted for K through 8 students and

0:00:31.320,0:00:34.170
we're trying to learn a couple establish

0:00:32.759,0:00:36.809
a mindset where they like to code

0:00:34.170,0:00:38.730
there's lots of reasons to code I mean

0:00:36.809,0:00:41.309
who knows how many different websites

0:00:38.730,0:00:42.390
with different reasons to code and

0:00:41.309,0:00:43.950
everybody always thinks it's like

0:00:42.390,0:00:46.079
because you want to become a computer

0:00:43.950,0:00:47.760
scientist when you grow up I'd say that

0:00:46.079,0:00:50.340
would be great there's definitely need

0:00:47.760,0:00:52.890
but if you look at like this 10 reasons

0:00:50.340,0:00:55.379
kids should learn to code it's for like

0:00:52.890,0:00:57.000
improving their other skills right and

0:00:55.379,0:00:58.440
then number 10 is maybe career

0:00:57.000,0:01:00.539
preparation so that's kind of the

0:00:58.440,0:01:03.239
motivation for awhile we run the camp

0:01:00.539,0:01:05.820
we've run this camp for a total of four

0:01:03.239,0:01:08.250
years this year is very different than

0:01:05.820,0:01:10.590
any previous year in the past we always

0:01:08.250,0:01:13.200
do it unrolls Holmen campus we hire

0:01:10.590,0:01:15.150
Ruhlman students to participate this

0:01:13.200,0:01:16.350
year it's got to be a video right that's

0:01:15.150,0:01:19.500
just kind of the time when we live in

0:01:16.350,0:01:21.750
right now we're offering two camps this

0:01:19.500,0:01:23.360
one is called the scratch camp which is

0:01:21.750,0:01:26.460
a terrible name because we're actually

0:01:23.360,0:01:28.560
changing from scratch to something

0:01:26.460,0:01:30.180
called tinker instead so maybe you

0:01:28.560,0:01:31.560
already know scratch reviewer familiar

0:01:30.180,0:01:33.240
of scratch scratch is a website it's

0:01:31.560,0:01:35.880
great we're actually gonna do the whole

0:01:33.240,0:01:38.250
thing with with tinker instead and

0:01:35.880,0:01:40.380
hopefully you watch the the log in video

0:01:38.250,0:01:42.450
to see how to get the log in but tinker

0:01:40.380,0:01:44.220
can do the same thing as a scratch and

0:01:42.450,0:01:45.390
it's the same coding concept so to me

0:01:44.220,0:01:49.320
it's not different but yeah but the

0:01:45.390,0:01:51.659
title is different and so that's kind of

0:01:49.320,0:01:53.430
what our goal is and this camp we're

0:01:51.659,0:01:55.829
going to be doing it for a total of five

0:01:53.430,0:01:57.750
days together I wanted to tell you just

0:01:55.829,0:01:59.340
a little bit about what I expect from

0:01:57.750,0:02:01.770
you so that you kind of know what's

0:01:59.340,0:02:03.719
going on so I expect that you've

0:02:01.770,0:02:06.210
received a login for me you can get in

0:02:03.719,0:02:08.099
to tinker with your kiddo and what

0:02:06.210,0:02:10.770
tinker is is it's really two things

0:02:08.099,0:02:12.239
it's projects which is what we're going

0:02:10.770,0:02:12.690
to do together in video so we're going

0:02:12.239,0:02:14.220
to go up

0:02:12.690,0:02:16.440
to my projects when we do things

0:02:14.220,0:02:18.510
together but then it's also activities

0:02:16.440,0:02:20.190
that you can do by yourself

0:02:18.510,0:02:21.900
so there's a lot of activities you can

0:02:20.190,0:02:24.540
do by yourself I've just put a couple up

0:02:21.900,0:02:26.520
so far a great one is called dragon

0:02:24.540,0:02:28.230
spells if you're enjoying a program with

0:02:26.520,0:02:29.610
your kid I won't go through all the

0:02:28.230,0:02:32.640
titles but there's a lot of things in

0:02:29.610,0:02:34.350
there there's also a lot of stem lessons

0:02:32.640,0:02:36.060
which are really cool things to kind of

0:02:34.350,0:02:37.560
learn about and after we've done a few

0:02:36.060,0:02:39.510
things together what you'll be able to

0:02:37.560,0:02:41.700
tackle anything I just to kind of show

0:02:39.510,0:02:43.560
you really briefly what one of these

0:02:41.700,0:02:46.950
looks like maybe I'll go into like the

0:02:43.560,0:02:49.080
Barbie one Barbie kind of introduces you

0:02:46.950,0:02:51.180
to tinker which I kind of like it's

0:02:49.080,0:02:53.670
great for girls obviously but the boys

0:02:51.180,0:02:55.320
are walking I doing it as well but these

0:02:53.670,0:02:57.930
are more like puzzles that you solve

0:02:55.320,0:02:59.010
right so in this one I'm to the step

0:02:57.930,0:03:01.680
where Barbie starts

0:02:59.010,0:03:04.650
solving her first puzzle right so we

0:03:01.680,0:03:07.980
want to use the the new costume command

0:03:04.650,0:03:10.680
and I'm going to get it wrong here and

0:03:07.980,0:03:12.210
so you're going to put on some code and

0:03:10.680,0:03:14.850
so that one was actually not the correct

0:03:12.210,0:03:17.340
answer and the idea with this one it

0:03:14.850,0:03:19.770
actually told me anything earlier you

0:03:17.340,0:03:21.989
need to keep using next costume to solve

0:03:19.770,0:03:24.030
the puzzle so the way these work is you

0:03:21.989,0:03:27.780
actually have code in your workspace

0:03:24.030,0:03:29.370
over here and you drag it over to

0:03:27.780,0:03:31.739
connect it over here and Barbie will go

0:03:29.370,0:03:34.080
through explaining tinker to you better

0:03:31.739,0:03:35.820
than I could by far but these are

0:03:34.080,0:03:37.620
puzzles that you try to slow on right

0:03:35.820,0:03:39.900
and so here I think that I've got the

0:03:37.620,0:03:43.140
solution to Barbies puzzle I'm not even

0:03:39.900,0:03:45.000
sure of that but hopefully it worked now

0:03:43.140,0:03:48.300
well I'm sure I can get us another time

0:03:45.000,0:03:50.820
so that's what we're gonna be doing on

0:03:48.300,0:03:52.560
your own and then what we're going to be

0:03:50.820,0:03:54.090
doing together is we're going to be

0:03:52.560,0:03:55.890
building projects and you'll see these

0:03:54.090,0:03:57.720
quite a bit but if you go to my projects

0:03:55.890,0:04:00.840
we're going to be creating a lot of new

0:03:57.720,0:04:03.510
projects together and this interface is

0:04:00.840,0:04:04.560
really a lot like scratch and that's

0:04:03.510,0:04:06.540
what we're going to be spending our time

0:04:04.560,0:04:08.580
in and I think that the kids are going

0:04:06.540,0:04:11.310
to really like it alright so we look

0:04:08.580,0:04:13.410
forward to to having you join our first

0:04:11.310,0:04:15.150
actual video but I wanted to give the

0:04:13.410,0:04:17.609
parents some background about what this

0:04:15.150,0:04:19.290
camp was and kind of what we expect from

0:04:17.609,0:04:21.019
you so see you when we start doing

0:04:19.290,0:04:24.629
things on Monday

0:04:21.019,0:04:24.629
