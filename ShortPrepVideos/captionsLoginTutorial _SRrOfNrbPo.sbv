0:00:03.799,0:00:08.309
all right this is a login video just

0:00:06.299,0:00:10.500
showing you what you need to do to get

0:00:08.309,0:00:12.150
yourself online with thinker so the

0:00:10.500,0:00:14.160
first thing you need to go do is you

0:00:12.150,0:00:19.369
need to go to tinker comm tinker is

0:00:14.160,0:00:21.539
spelt with a y so T Y in keer comm

0:00:19.369,0:00:23.850
assuming that you've got to login for me

0:00:21.539,0:00:26.490
you can actually just click on sign in

0:00:23.850,0:00:28.230
if you didn't get a login for me you'd

0:00:26.490,0:00:29.939
have to create an account but I made an

0:00:28.230,0:00:31.500
account for you there are three

0:00:29.939,0:00:34.050
different types of account on tinker

0:00:31.500,0:00:36.960
there's students which is what you are

0:00:34.050,0:00:38.879
there's teacher that's me and then if

0:00:36.960,0:00:40.530
you didn't get any help from anyone you

0:00:38.879,0:00:42.270
just signed in yourself you had to make

0:00:40.530,0:00:43.950
a parent account so I'm gonna show you

0:00:42.270,0:00:46.469
signing in just as a student because

0:00:43.950,0:00:48.750
this is what you should expect you can

0:00:46.469,0:00:51.960
see that I've done this once before so

0:00:48.750,0:00:54.600
it should be connecting with code 2020

0:00:51.960,0:00:56.910
and then your child's first and last

0:00:54.600,0:00:59.250
name all lowercase all smushed together

0:00:56.910,0:01:00.809
some people we had to add like a 2/4 or

0:00:59.250,0:01:02.250
something like that or if you didn't

0:01:00.809,0:01:04.739
provide the last name for this be first

0:01:02.250,0:01:08.790
name and then the password for everybody

0:01:04.739,0:01:11.040
is just CWC 20/20 so it's just the same

0:01:08.790,0:01:13.020
first characters are the same seven

0:01:11.040,0:01:16.049
first characters as in your username

0:01:13.020,0:01:18.720
right once you do that you just click on

0:01:16.049,0:01:21.869
enter on now you're into the tinkerer

0:01:18.720,0:01:23.759
system inside the tinkerer system you're

0:01:21.869,0:01:25.950
probably only in one class so you should

0:01:23.759,0:01:28.200
be in the in the connecting with code

0:01:25.950,0:01:31.290
camp there's a number of different

0:01:28.200,0:01:34.530
follow along activities and these things

0:01:31.290,0:01:35.820
are great for you to do anytime you want

0:01:34.530,0:01:37.979
it doesn't have to be with me as a

0:01:35.820,0:01:41.100

0:01:41.100,0:01:44.310
