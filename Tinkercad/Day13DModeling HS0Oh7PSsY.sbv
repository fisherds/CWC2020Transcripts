0:00:03.839,0:00:10.389
hey hey welcome to the week to camp with

0:00:08.290,0:00:11.500
Tinkercad ice what we're going to be

0:00:10.389,0:00:14.110
doing this week is we're going to be

0:00:11.500,0:00:15.219
learning about a software tool that's

0:00:14.110,0:00:17.800
called tinker camp

0:00:15.219,0:00:21.399
available at Tinkercad calm and

0:00:17.800,0:00:23.439
Tinkercad is the focus of the camp for

0:00:21.399,0:00:26.050
this week if you do want some more stuff

0:00:23.439,0:00:28.059
with tinker you can go look at the the

0:00:26.050,0:00:29.770
camp page for for last week's camp

0:00:28.059,0:00:32.230
there's all kinds of stuff with with

0:00:29.770,0:00:34.899
tinker's botha why but you're hopefully

0:00:32.230,0:00:35.739
here particular tad and what we're going

0:00:34.899,0:00:37.239
to be doing is we're going to be

0:00:35.739,0:00:39.370
learning about the software tools that

0:00:37.239,0:00:42.820
are available here this camp is kind of

0:00:39.370,0:00:45.820
appropriate for fourth graders up

0:00:42.820,0:00:47.469
through eighth graders I've got one in

0:00:45.820,0:00:50.339
my family that fits that description

0:00:47.469,0:00:53.980
how would you like to introduce yourself

0:00:50.339,0:00:56.230
and she is in fourth grade and she's

0:00:53.980,0:00:59.739
going to be following along with

0:00:56.230,0:01:00.969
Tinkercad with us if you were watching

0:00:59.739,0:01:02.589
last week we had the whole family here

0:01:00.969,0:01:04.390
but this time it's just me and McKinley

0:01:02.589,0:01:06.280
and so what we're going to be doing is

0:01:04.390,0:01:08.620
we're going to be learning about three

0:01:06.280,0:01:12.400
different tools that Tinkercad offers

0:01:08.620,0:01:15.340
first off what is taken cad Tinkercad is

0:01:12.400,0:01:16.870
a website that's completely free it's

0:01:15.340,0:01:18.820
meant to encourage young people to

0:01:16.870,0:01:21.130
become makers maybe you've heard the

0:01:18.820,0:01:23.380
term like makerspace or 3d printing or

0:01:21.130,0:01:25.120
things like that but Tinkercad is all

0:01:23.380,0:01:26.890
about helping kids become makers and

0:01:25.120,0:01:28.780
their tools are actually really really

0:01:26.890,0:01:30.640
good I to the point that we use them in

0:01:28.780,0:01:32.140
college classes sometimes right there's

0:01:30.640,0:01:33.580
three different tools there's 3d

0:01:32.140,0:01:34.510
designer which is what we're learning

0:01:33.580,0:01:37.810
about today

0:01:34.510,0:01:39.970
there's circuits which we're going to

0:01:37.810,0:01:41.830
learn about for three days so circuits

0:01:39.970,0:01:45.130
is Tuesday Wednesday Thursday so the

0:01:41.830,0:01:47.110
heart of this camp is circuits and that

0:01:45.130,0:01:49.480
on Friday the very last day is going to

0:01:47.110,0:01:50.950
be about codeblocks and so hopefully

0:01:49.480,0:01:53.110
you're able to sign in on Tinkercad

0:01:50.950,0:01:55.150
using the the credentials that I sent

0:01:53.110,0:01:57.840
you and it's fine that we started

0:01:55.150,0:02:01.000
learning so we're going to learn a new

0:01:57.840,0:02:02.980
3d software tool we're going to build a

0:02:01.000,0:02:04.870
couple of projects today I'm just going

0:02:02.980,0:02:07.510
to show you kind of like my solutions

0:02:04.870,0:02:10.420
one of our solutions is going to be a

0:02:07.510,0:02:12.999
rocket ship so here is the rocket ship

0:02:10.420,0:02:14.859
and so we're just going to kind of be

0:02:12.999,0:02:16.140
learning about different techniques to

0:02:14.859,0:02:17.819
do 3d modeling

0:02:16.140,0:02:20.850
and then we're also going to build

0:02:17.819,0:02:22.890
another one called a house and this

0:02:20.850,0:02:25.170
house is actually following along with

0:02:22.890,0:02:29.069
the tutorial that someone at Tinkercad

0:02:25.170,0:02:31.620
made he made a blog post about building

0:02:29.069,0:02:35.160
a Tinkercad house and so those are our

0:02:31.620,0:02:37.440
two projects today so let's go ahead and

0:02:35.160,0:02:39.630
get started so to get started what I

0:02:37.440,0:02:42.540
want to do first is I want to actually

0:02:39.630,0:02:43.830
work the tutorials with you we're going

0:02:42.540,0:02:45.360
to kind of work I'm going to accelerate

0:02:43.830,0:02:48.060
the pace but feel free to always pause

0:02:45.360,0:02:49.739
the video whenever you like so we want

0:02:48.060,0:02:51.930
to work the tutorials through tutorials

0:02:49.739,0:02:53.370
are called like place it and move it and

0:02:51.930,0:02:55.800
things like that so where do you find

0:02:53.370,0:02:57.090
their tutorials well there's a bunch of

0:02:55.800,0:02:58.739
ways to get there I kind of like to

0:02:57.090,0:03:01.019
click on the link at the top right that

0:02:58.739,0:03:05.040
says learn so go ahead and click on this

0:03:01.019,0:03:06.540
link that says learn and what you can do

0:03:05.040,0:03:10.650
we're going to make you screen for here

0:03:06.540,0:03:13.019
is you can learn about 3d modeling or

0:03:10.650,0:03:15.000
you can learn about circuits or you

0:03:13.019,0:03:18.450
could learn about code blocks and today

0:03:15.000,0:03:21.690
of course is 3d modeling so 3d modeling

0:03:18.450,0:03:24.570
is very important because I let you

0:03:21.690,0:03:27.150
build things that you design for the

0:03:24.570,0:03:29.400
physical world it's also really big in

0:03:27.150,0:03:31.799
Tinkercad to make things in 3d print

0:03:29.400,0:03:33.329
them and if you happen to have access to

0:03:31.799,0:03:35.070
a 3d printer then you can actually just

0:03:33.329,0:03:37.590
print the things you make which is

0:03:35.070,0:03:39.600
amazing you can also order 3d prints

0:03:37.590,0:03:41.519
with that cost money right so let's go

0:03:39.600,0:03:45.209
ahead and start learning about their

0:03:41.519,0:03:46.920
lessons and starters so I think that

0:03:45.209,0:03:50.220
they're called starters so I'm gonna

0:03:46.920,0:03:52.829
click on see all starters so when I

0:03:50.220,0:03:54.540
click on see all starters it takes me to

0:03:52.829,0:03:56.880
a page like this and this is what I was

0:03:54.540,0:03:58.769
looking for I place it view it move it

0:03:56.880,0:04:00.989
rotate it size it and grow it and align

0:03:58.769,0:04:02.190
it so there's 7 tutorials I don't know

0:04:00.989,0:04:04.079
you're like 7 tutorials so it's gonna

0:04:02.190,0:04:06.989
take like an hour I they're all short

0:04:04.079,0:04:09.570
right so go ahead and click on the

0:04:06.989,0:04:11.010
starter 4 places and the nice thing is

0:04:09.570,0:04:12.060
is that once you finish place it

0:04:11.010,0:04:15.269
there'll be a link to where you can just

0:04:12.060,0:04:19.019
go on to the next one so this is the

0:04:15.269,0:04:20.940
Tinkercad 3d modeling environment so you

0:04:19.019,0:04:23.580
can see that the main thing here is the

0:04:20.940,0:04:25.500
the workplane where you work you've also

0:04:23.580,0:04:27.870
got like shapes that you can drag on

0:04:25.500,0:04:28.569
here and then this box over on the left

0:04:27.870,0:04:30.099
this is the two

0:04:28.569,0:04:33.099
- all right so those are the different

0:04:30.099,0:04:34.990
things to work today one thing that I do

0:04:33.099,0:04:37.449
recommend you use is a mouse

0:04:34.990,0:04:40.599
so you'll see why as we get into it but

0:04:37.449,0:04:41.860
if you're a 3d modeler you use the right

0:04:40.599,0:04:44.800
mouse button the left mouse button

0:04:41.860,0:04:46.809
scroll wheel you'll use it also like

0:04:44.800,0:04:48.610
it's way better than a trackpad so I do

0:04:46.809,0:04:51.580
recommend that you get a mouse can you

0:04:48.610,0:04:54.189
do it without a mouse sure you got is it

0:04:51.580,0:04:56.169
better with the mouse alright so here's

0:04:54.189,0:04:58.779
the placeit tutorial so this shows you

0:04:56.169,0:05:01.149
how to actually like add things to your

0:04:58.779,0:05:03.819
model and so the goal is we're going to

0:05:01.149,0:05:06.639
add one of these orange sorry red cubes

0:05:03.819,0:05:08.349
this block and the goal of this tutorial

0:05:06.639,0:05:10.749
is to try to get a position right there

0:05:08.349,0:05:13.240
right so what you need to do is you need

0:05:10.749,0:05:15.339
to grab it from the side and try your

0:05:13.240,0:05:17.199
best just to put it right on the orange

0:05:15.339,0:05:19.689
on line I know I think I can pretty well

0:05:17.199,0:05:21.339
hit mine but even if I miss it's okay

0:05:19.689,0:05:24.879
but my goal is to try to like drop it

0:05:21.339,0:05:27.699
right on there if you miss by a little

0:05:24.879,0:05:28.659
bit that's alright you could always try

0:05:27.699,0:05:30.459
to fix it

0:05:28.659,0:05:32.529
one way you can fix it is you can zoom

0:05:30.459,0:05:35.649
in here's a plus button that will kind

0:05:32.529,0:05:37.869
of help you zoom in and then you can

0:05:35.649,0:05:40.269
click it and you can just try to try to

0:05:37.869,0:05:42.759
drag it around but I'm trying to get it

0:05:40.269,0:05:44.740
like right on there little preview

0:05:42.759,0:05:46.329
window and as soon as I think I've got

0:05:44.740,0:05:49.089
it there that I'm ready for the next

0:05:46.329,0:05:50.409
step so pretty easy first step and it

0:05:49.089,0:05:52.360
actually turns out that that's the whole

0:05:50.409,0:05:54.729
tutorial right well that's one of the

0:05:52.360,0:05:56.649
seven tutorials if you succeed in

0:05:54.729,0:05:59.319
getting it to the perfect spot they

0:05:56.649,0:06:01.719
reward you with stars so there are

0:05:59.319,0:06:03.009
lessons are very short and directed this

0:06:01.719,0:06:05.139
one was showing you the main thing you

0:06:03.009,0:06:07.719
do and that's grabbing things and

0:06:05.139,0:06:09.099
dropping them into the workplane you

0:06:07.719,0:06:10.779
don't need to grab other things I'm just

0:06:09.099,0:06:12.909
kind of showing you that that's that's

0:06:10.779,0:06:15.300
kind of how Tinkercad works is you grab

0:06:12.909,0:06:17.259
things from over there and you drop them

0:06:15.300,0:06:20.649
once you're done with this you can click

0:06:17.259,0:06:22.689
on done and then it says hey you've made

0:06:20.649,0:06:27.009
it time for the next lesson for view it

0:06:22.689,0:06:31.839
so you click on continue so one lesson

0:06:27.009,0:06:34.659
down six more to go and we're gonna

0:06:31.839,0:06:36.699
start learning about take your pad so

0:06:34.659,0:06:38.469
this lesson again you can pause it if

0:06:36.699,0:06:39.879
you prefer to just read the instructions

0:06:38.469,0:06:42.039
but I'm gonna kind of walk you through

0:06:39.879,0:06:42.220
it together the first thing it's telling

0:06:42.039,0:06:44.440
you

0:06:42.220,0:06:45.760
do is this this is all about view it so

0:06:44.440,0:06:48.040
it's all about viewing it from different

0:06:45.760,0:06:50.500
directions you can see that the block

0:06:48.040,0:06:52.720
that we're viewing is an awesome like

0:06:50.500,0:06:53.770
part because it just says the word front

0:06:52.720,0:06:55.810
right on the front

0:06:53.770,0:06:56.860
I says the word top are on the top so

0:06:55.810,0:06:58.990
the first thing that's telling you do

0:06:56.860,0:07:01.750
you to do is to grab this little they

0:06:58.990,0:07:03.540
call it the view tube so if you grab it

0:07:01.750,0:07:05.530
you can kind of move it around

0:07:03.540,0:07:09.820
that's kind of cool so you can kind of

0:07:05.530,0:07:11.770
see it from the top from the front from

0:07:09.820,0:07:13.270
the right from the left you just kind of

0:07:11.770,0:07:15.400
move it around wherever you can even see

0:07:13.270,0:07:18.100
the bottom on this thing so the view

0:07:15.400,0:07:21.010
cube is one important way to try to like

0:07:18.100,0:07:24.400
navigate and see what's what I'm gonna

0:07:21.010,0:07:27.280
click on next year the next thing that's

0:07:24.400,0:07:29.860
important is the zoom tool you can zoom

0:07:27.280,0:07:34.270
by clicking on this plus that's one way

0:07:29.860,0:07:35.800
to zoom in and so that's a good way to

0:07:34.270,0:07:37.870
zoom in now to be honest you can also

0:07:35.800,0:07:40.600
click on the minus here to zoom out I

0:07:37.870,0:07:43.630
rarely ever use these plus and minus

0:07:40.600,0:07:46.600
buttons personally I use sometimes I use

0:07:43.630,0:07:48.790
this fit button it's nice it just kind

0:07:46.600,0:07:51.250
of makes it fit but other than that I

0:07:48.790,0:07:55.690
use my scroll wheel on my mouse so if I

0:07:51.250,0:07:58.060
scroll out I kind of zoom way out and if

0:07:55.690,0:07:59.590
I scroll in then i zoom way in right so

0:07:58.060,0:08:01.870
if you have a mouse with a scroll wheel

0:07:59.590,0:08:03.190
you'll never need those two buttons ever

0:08:01.870,0:08:04.960
again because you just use your scroll

0:08:03.190,0:08:07.690
wheel and then find that being good at

0:08:04.960,0:08:09.220
CAD is actually kind of like like being

0:08:07.690,0:08:11.290
able to type right like when you want

0:08:09.220,0:08:13.360
something to happen you you can just do

0:08:11.290,0:08:15.490
it without even thinking about it also

0:08:13.360,0:08:17.470
say that the viewcube here you can use

0:08:15.490,0:08:19.750
it to rotate around but there's actually

0:08:17.470,0:08:20.590
a better way to rotate around McKinley

0:08:19.750,0:08:34.300
do you know what the better way to

0:08:20.590,0:08:35.890
rotate around this so this is actually

0:08:34.300,0:08:37.630
way easier than the cube so I never

0:08:35.890,0:08:39.430
actually used the cube anymore once I

0:08:37.630,0:08:41.589
learned this trick if I have a mouse and

0:08:39.430,0:08:43.750
I have a right mouse button I can click

0:08:41.589,0:08:46.210
and hold the right mouse button and I

0:08:43.750,0:08:48.430
can kind of use that to rotate it around

0:08:46.210,0:08:50.589
which is kind of cool I said thanks the

0:08:48.430,0:08:53.270
question of what happens if you like

0:08:50.589,0:08:54.860
don't want to just rotate if you want to

0:08:53.270,0:08:57.260
this if you happen to have a mouse with

0:08:54.860,0:08:59.060
a center wheel you can push on it and

0:08:57.260,0:09:02.450
you can drag around and it'll let you

0:08:59.060,0:09:04.280
pay in side-to-side so some people call

0:09:02.450,0:09:06.620
right mouse click orbit so you can orbit

0:09:04.280,0:09:11.510
around your part and then the mouse

0:09:06.620,0:09:13.280
wheel would beep and so those are some

0:09:11.510,0:09:15.950
some useful things I think it's going to

0:09:13.280,0:09:17.900
tell us some more tips here so oh here's

0:09:15.950,0:09:20.300
the right mouse button tricks oh yeah

0:09:17.900,0:09:22.730
that one's definitely a big one other

0:09:20.300,0:09:24.440
tricks are that if you want to view

0:09:22.730,0:09:26.840
something straight from the front you

0:09:24.440,0:09:29.570
can click on the cube here and it'll

0:09:26.840,0:09:32.060
zoom you to the front also if you look

0:09:29.570,0:09:34.400
at there's an arrow above the cube you

0:09:32.060,0:09:37.370
can flip it to view it straight from the

0:09:34.400,0:09:39.320
top another thing that I don't think

0:09:37.370,0:09:41.150
they tell you about in the tutorial but

0:09:39.320,0:09:43.910
I kind of like to do I get your view

0:09:41.150,0:09:47.000
towards from the top I like to switch

0:09:43.910,0:09:49.640
the view between what's called

0:09:47.000,0:09:51.920
orthographic and projection view this

0:09:49.640,0:09:53.360
sounds awfully advanced right um but

0:09:51.920,0:09:55.870
let's click on this bottom button and

0:09:53.360,0:09:59.390
maybe to see the difference a

0:09:55.870,0:10:01.190
orthographic view is not something

0:09:59.390,0:10:03.380
that's like possible with your eye and a

0:10:01.190,0:10:06.080
real object because obviously there's no

0:10:03.380,0:10:07.940
way to see this side and the side and

0:10:06.080,0:10:09.830
the side and the side in a real world

0:10:07.940,0:10:10.640
that's really what you would do if you

0:10:09.830,0:10:12.200
were standing here you'd see a

0:10:10.640,0:10:13.820
perspective and then would be hidden

0:10:12.200,0:10:17.390
right it's like the size of it hidden

0:10:13.820,0:10:19.460
but an orthographic view lets you see

0:10:17.390,0:10:20.840
things as if it's like perfectly

0:10:19.460,0:10:23.090
straight down from the top so if you're

0:10:20.840,0:10:25.760
if your vantage point was infinitely far

0:10:23.090,0:10:27.980
away with the telescope right um so I

0:10:25.760,0:10:30.350
find the perspective and orthographic

0:10:27.980,0:10:32.660
view very useful as I'm building models

0:10:30.350,0:10:34.760
and we'll just see how it comes up when

0:10:32.660,0:10:37.070
we start doing things but I think I'm

0:10:34.760,0:10:38.710
starting to get the hang of rotating

0:10:37.070,0:10:41.990
around using my right mouse button

0:10:38.710,0:10:45.710
zooming using the mouse wheel if I want

0:10:41.990,0:10:47.690
to I can use the hold down the mouse

0:10:45.710,0:10:49.250
wheel to pan and then whenever you want

0:10:47.690,0:10:51.950
to you can just click on view all and

0:10:49.250,0:10:53.540
it'll kinda fix it up for you so there's

0:10:51.950,0:10:56.240
nothing tried to do in this tutorial so

0:10:53.540,0:10:58.580
I get my stars I just first successfully

0:10:56.240,0:11:00.830
clicking the next button 3 times did you

0:10:58.580,0:11:03.080
get fancy stars McKinley all right so

0:11:00.830,0:11:06.490
we're doing good so we're done with view

0:11:03.080,0:11:09.160
it as I mentioned there were 7

0:11:06.490,0:11:11.050
so there's two of them that are done and

0:11:09.160,0:11:12.070
we've got five to go so we're chugging

0:11:11.050,0:11:15.010
away through these things

0:11:12.070,0:11:17.680
this one is move it so I'm going to

0:11:15.010,0:11:19.000
click on next here and it says what it

0:11:17.680,0:11:22.260
wants you to do is I want you to move

0:11:19.000,0:11:25.480
these blocks tour they're perfectly

0:11:22.260,0:11:27.940
aligned in these areas now one way to do

0:11:25.480,0:11:30.790
this tutorial is just to use the view

0:11:27.940,0:11:34.390
that they've got and you single click on

0:11:30.790,0:11:35.830
one and then you drag and move it now

0:11:34.390,0:11:38.050
whenever you're doing these tutorials

0:11:35.830,0:11:39.760
sometimes things go great and you just

0:11:38.050,0:11:41.950
put it right in the spot sometimes they

0:11:39.760,0:11:43.330
go lousy let's say I clicked on one of

0:11:41.950,0:11:45.760
these blocks and I'm gonna do something

0:11:43.330,0:11:47.440
wrong instead of grabbing like where

0:11:45.760,0:11:48.910
there's no handles and moving it that's

0:11:47.440,0:11:51.550
what you're supposed to do let's say I

0:11:48.910,0:11:54.220
accidentally grabbed like this white

0:11:51.550,0:11:56.140
square and then I started dragging it

0:11:54.220,0:11:57.790
and then started getting taller my big

0:11:56.140,0:12:01.420
oh no I didn't mean to make it taller I

0:11:57.790,0:12:04.750
just made a huge undo is your friends so

0:12:01.420,0:12:06.970
you click on undo so as I mentioned one

0:12:04.750,0:12:09.370
way to do this is to just kind of get it

0:12:06.970,0:12:10.750
into the position other things you can

0:12:09.370,0:12:12.820
do is you can practice some of those

0:12:10.750,0:12:14.950
other skills you've been working on so

0:12:12.820,0:12:17.620
for example this puzzle might be easiest

0:12:14.950,0:12:20.079
to solve if I viewed it from the top and

0:12:17.620,0:12:24.220
it might be easiest if I switched it to

0:12:20.079,0:12:27.070
an orthographic projection and it might

0:12:24.220,0:12:29.470
be easiest if I kind of use my zoom

0:12:27.070,0:12:31.060
skills that I learned to kind of like

0:12:29.470,0:12:33.579
move to where I could see this thing

0:12:31.060,0:12:35.320
better right and then there I know I

0:12:33.579,0:12:37.630
just crushed that alright so I put it

0:12:35.320,0:12:41.320
right right into that and so I really

0:12:37.630,0:12:43.300
like getting good at at using my legs

0:12:41.320,0:12:45.310
oome tools so here I'm just using my

0:12:43.300,0:12:47.860
scroll wheel to check that one that one

0:12:45.310,0:12:49.959
looks good and I like to use the pan

0:12:47.860,0:12:52.510
sometimes the pan is pushed down on the

0:12:49.959,0:12:54.670
scroll wheel and I can just kind of see

0:12:52.510,0:12:56.290
that all these things look right and so

0:12:54.670,0:12:58.440
now I've just kind of got one left to go

0:12:56.290,0:13:01.959
and I want to move this guy right here

0:12:58.440,0:13:03.490
to be right into this water and I can

0:13:01.959,0:13:06.670
zoom in on it or I can hit this fit

0:13:03.490,0:13:09.160
button and I can just kind of see yep it

0:13:06.670,0:13:09.579
fits everything that I want now to zoom

0:13:09.160,0:13:11.529
out

0:13:09.579,0:13:13.930
I can click off of that object I can

0:13:11.529,0:13:16.089
click on the fit again and so it'll kind

0:13:13.930,0:13:17.740
of fit everything and then before I

0:13:16.089,0:13:19.990
leave something what I like to do is I

0:13:17.740,0:13:21.580
like to put it back into

0:13:19.990,0:13:23.620
it's called an isometric view kind of a

0:13:21.580,0:13:26.860
side view and I like for it to be viewed

0:13:23.620,0:13:29.040
as the perspective so there I have

0:13:26.860,0:13:31.720
successfully moved my four blocks

0:13:29.040,0:13:33.910
perfectly in the little orange things

0:13:31.720,0:13:36.220
and hopefully I'll get stars when I

0:13:33.910,0:13:37.000
click on the the next button I must have

0:13:36.220,0:13:39.160
done it perfect

0:13:37.000,0:13:41.350
I get stars they're kind of mean to you

0:13:39.160,0:13:44.290
if you don't get stars one or two things

0:13:41.350,0:13:46.510
happen either you didn't have perfect or

0:13:44.290,0:13:47.920
they're a little program glitched and

0:13:46.510,0:13:51.850
then you miss the stars right but you

0:13:47.920,0:13:55.810
should get stars I quote McKinley did

0:13:51.850,0:13:57.370
you get stars on that one well so if

0:13:55.810,0:13:58.690
you're having problems what I want you

0:13:57.370,0:14:01.029
to do is I want you to pause the video

0:13:58.690,0:14:04.209
and play with it until you get there

0:14:01.029,0:14:06.670
practice makes perfect don't feel bad if

0:14:04.209,0:14:08.170
it takes you a while right like I click

0:14:06.670,0:14:10.060
and and it's like everything goes

0:14:08.170,0:14:11.980
perfect and then when you do it it's

0:14:10.060,0:14:13.450
like everything goes wrong I assure you

0:14:11.980,0:14:15.279
that whenever I started everything went

0:14:13.450,0:14:17.580
wrong for me too it's just that I've

0:14:15.279,0:14:19.750
been doing this stuff for a long time I

0:14:17.580,0:14:23.050
next tutorial what are we up to here I

0:14:19.750,0:14:24.730
think this is for is rotated so we're

0:14:23.050,0:14:27.070
learning about how to manipulate our

0:14:24.730,0:14:28.660
objects they're easy to drag and bring

0:14:27.070,0:14:30.730
on to the screen but then how you

0:14:28.660,0:14:32.320
manipulate on my is what's important so

0:14:30.730,0:14:34.510
you can see that this one there's going

0:14:32.320,0:14:36.730
to be three different challenges we've

0:14:34.510,0:14:39.010
got to rotate these cubes in different

0:14:36.730,0:14:41.920
ways so what I'm gonna do is I'm going

0:14:39.010,0:14:45.550
to kind of zoom in on one at a time I

0:14:41.920,0:14:46.839
could click on it here and say fit and

0:14:45.550,0:14:50.079
that would kind of get me zoomed in on

0:14:46.839,0:14:51.880
it better but you can also use your pan

0:14:50.079,0:14:52.660
tools and so you kind of get get where

0:14:51.880,0:14:55.600
you look at this one

0:14:52.660,0:14:57.310
so this one I need to rotate you know in

0:14:55.600,0:14:59.260
this direction to make it match up with

0:14:57.310,0:15:01.329
the little ghost image so I'm gonna

0:14:59.260,0:15:04.300
click on my block here that I'm wanting

0:15:01.329,0:15:07.000
to rotate and I've got to find the right

0:15:04.300,0:15:09.610
handle let's pause for a minute and look

0:15:07.000,0:15:11.529
at these handles so the one that I want

0:15:09.610,0:15:13.270
is this one back here this is a rotate

0:15:11.529,0:15:15.100
side to side but let's look at some of

0:15:13.270,0:15:18.040
the other handles you notice that each

0:15:15.100,0:15:20.140
corner has a little white handle so if I

0:15:18.040,0:15:21.640
wanted to resize the box I could grab

0:15:20.140,0:15:23.440
one of these handles so I could affect

0:15:21.640,0:15:26.680
like the the size of the bottom here

0:15:23.440,0:15:28.690
each edge on the bottom has a little

0:15:26.680,0:15:30.610
black handle black handles if you want

0:15:28.690,0:15:32.860
to pull it in just one direction those

0:15:30.610,0:15:33.290
black handles are nice there's also this

0:15:32.860,0:15:35.570
little

0:15:33.290,0:15:38.750
like cone thing here the cone will let

0:15:35.570,0:15:40.040
me move the block up whereas the white

0:15:38.750,0:15:42.560
handle would let me make the block

0:15:40.040,0:15:44.930
taller so I make sense so the one that I

0:15:42.560,0:15:47.449
want right now is this guy back here so

0:15:44.930,0:15:50.300
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to click

0:15:47.449,0:15:52.940
and drag on it so when you click on it

0:15:50.300,0:15:53.600
and drag nips old one will have in

0:15:52.940,0:15:55.819
trouble

0:15:53.600,0:15:58.370
definitely takes six times so I'll click

0:15:55.819,0:16:00.639
on this again so they're popped up right

0:15:58.370,0:16:03.199
so I'm gonna click and drag on it now

0:16:00.639,0:16:06.050
I'm holding down the left mouse button

0:16:03.199,0:16:09.529
and I'm moving it around you'll notice

0:16:06.050,0:16:12.230
that line right now is moving in kind of

0:16:09.529,0:16:14.600
big steps right that's because I'm

0:16:12.230,0:16:15.980
currently inside that circle so you kind

0:16:14.600,0:16:18.319
of imagine that there's a circle there

0:16:15.980,0:16:20.180
if I was outside the circle so farther

0:16:18.319,0:16:22.310
away I can move it a very exact amount

0:16:20.180,0:16:24.350
it's like if I wanted to move it exactly

0:16:22.310,0:16:26.209
like 41 degrees I could do that outside

0:16:24.350,0:16:28.519
the circle but if you bring your mouse

0:16:26.209,0:16:31.430
inside the circle then that'll let you

0:16:28.519,0:16:34.940
move it a big step amount right so I

0:16:31.430,0:16:37.160
want exactly 45 degrees so I want to

0:16:34.940,0:16:38.810
kind of be inside the circle so there

0:16:37.160,0:16:42.829
I've got that one moved to the right

0:16:38.810,0:16:45.529
spot one down two more to go

0:16:42.829,0:16:48.350
so the next one and again pause it for

0:16:45.529,0:16:49.370
you if you need more time the next one

0:16:48.350,0:16:51.620
the first thing I've got to do is I

0:16:49.370,0:16:53.120
gotta find the right handle so you know

0:16:51.620,0:16:55.819
which handle do I want well there's this

0:16:53.120,0:16:57.800
handle there's that handle those would

0:16:55.819,0:16:59.930
rotate me insert directions aha the one

0:16:57.800,0:17:02.089
that I want is actually this bottom

0:16:59.930,0:17:04.130
handle because what needs to happen is

0:17:02.089,0:17:08.419
it needs to rotate using this bottom

0:17:04.130,0:17:10.819
direction towards the 45 degrees again

0:17:08.419,0:17:13.100
as I click on it so it's kind of like a

0:17:10.819,0:17:15.110
you click and then I'm just I'm holding

0:17:13.100,0:17:17.750
down that left mouse button and drag I

0:17:15.110,0:17:20.929
can move inside that circle to do like

0:17:17.750,0:17:23.720
exact big movements or I can be outside

0:17:20.929,0:17:26.179
that circle to to like really fine grain

0:17:23.720,0:17:27.409
control and as long as we hit 45 it

0:17:26.179,0:17:31.580
doesn't matter what you use so if I do

0:17:27.409,0:17:34.370
45 exactly using the outside then that

0:17:31.580,0:17:37.490
I'm all set there but it's sometimes

0:17:34.370,0:17:39.380
easier to use the inside to solve

0:17:37.490,0:17:41.480
something like this I also mentioned

0:17:39.380,0:17:44.090
that you can type so let's say I put it

0:17:41.480,0:17:46.309
down I put it at 32 on accident oh I

0:17:44.090,0:17:47.090
just let go of it at 32 and then I just

0:17:46.309,0:17:50.840
click on

0:17:47.090,0:17:55.159
45 and I type four or five hit enter and

0:17:50.840,0:17:55.909
that also gets me right great so I'm

0:17:55.159,0:17:59.539
doing good

0:17:55.909,0:18:01.820
I've got one more to go you can see

0:17:59.539,0:18:04.789
we're being able to get around your

0:18:01.820,0:18:06.590
drawing is a very useful skill so I kind

0:18:04.789,0:18:10.460
of come over to the next one here with a

0:18:06.590,0:18:12.679
combination of right-mouse orbits and I

0:18:10.460,0:18:15.650
use that Center scroll we'll hold down

0:18:12.679,0:18:18.500
pain so this one I think you kind of get

0:18:15.650,0:18:20.870
the idea I want to figure out which axes

0:18:18.500,0:18:23.840
to rotate it about and I want to use

0:18:20.870,0:18:28.940
this axes that is on the back so I'm

0:18:23.840,0:18:30.830
going to click and drag and I'm old I

0:18:28.940,0:18:33.049
will hide what's going on here I'm going

0:18:30.830,0:18:35.630
to use the inside the circle option so

0:18:33.049,0:18:38.450
that I get a nice perfect 45 and it's

0:18:35.630,0:18:40.279
easy to do and I like I know it should

0:18:38.450,0:18:42.649
happen is I should have them all three

0:18:40.279,0:18:43.940
rotated to be honest I didn't read the

0:18:42.649,0:18:46.640
instructions at all because it was

0:18:43.940,0:18:51.020
obvious what I needed to do based on the

0:18:46.640,0:18:53.750
illustrations I hit next and I get my

0:18:51.020,0:18:55.730
stars going good for you alright so

0:18:53.750,0:18:57.620
let's move on to the next one I've

0:18:55.730,0:19:01.309
honestly lost track of how many we're in

0:18:57.620,0:19:04.640
this is what this this is five well

0:19:01.309,0:19:06.770
pretend like it's five five out of seven

0:19:04.640,0:19:09.010
McKinley just asked how many more we got

0:19:06.770,0:19:12.020
and I said well there's like three more

0:19:09.010,0:19:13.700
but this is how you learn a tool right

0:19:12.020,0:19:15.770
so before you can do amazing things you

0:19:13.700,0:19:17.809
got to learn at first rate this one

0:19:15.770,0:19:20.809
we're resizing things so we're going to

0:19:17.809,0:19:25.159
use those other handles to do different

0:19:20.809,0:19:28.100
sizing things so this one this first

0:19:25.159,0:19:30.049
challenge is to make it wider and really

0:19:28.100,0:19:33.710
the the best way to do it is to grab

0:19:30.049,0:19:34.909
this black handle on this side and then

0:19:33.710,0:19:38.919
the black hand on the other side and

0:19:34.909,0:19:41.240
move it to where it matches the block

0:19:38.919,0:19:43.940
now there are other ways you can do it

0:19:41.240,0:19:45.649
you can grab white handles as well but I

0:19:43.940,0:19:47.360
think those black handles are going to

0:19:45.649,0:19:50.000
do it again here those black handles are

0:19:47.360,0:19:52.640
really what's best because they'll move

0:19:50.000,0:19:53.929
it in just that direction if you wanted

0:19:52.640,0:19:56.059
to move it with a white handle you

0:19:53.929,0:19:57.380
totally could it would it would work

0:19:56.059,0:19:58.039
just the same but a white handle you got

0:19:57.380,0:20:00.020
to be careful that you don't

0:19:58.039,0:20:00.750
accidentally move it in a different

0:20:00.020,0:20:03.090
direction

0:20:00.750,0:20:05.700
what you reading right so I do recommend

0:20:03.090,0:20:06.960
those black handles and then they kind

0:20:05.700,0:20:08.940
of had me do it three times I like

0:20:06.960,0:20:11.340
Tinkercad that you can click on a block

0:20:08.940,0:20:13.380
and then once you click on it like

0:20:11.340,0:20:15.870
they'll let you grab the handles even if

0:20:13.380,0:20:18.510
it's like not physically possible right

0:20:15.870,0:20:20.460
it's like this back one here I wanted to

0:20:18.510,0:20:22.860
kind of like move it to the right spot

0:20:20.460,0:20:25.290
if you think you can hit it from this

0:20:22.860,0:20:27.630
view feel free to go ahead and try to

0:20:25.290,0:20:29.910
match it up perfect but if you don't

0:20:27.630,0:20:32.820
think that you can hit it get good at

0:20:29.910,0:20:36.900
orbiting around and get to where you can

0:20:32.820,0:20:40.920
see it like really well and zoom in as

0:20:36.900,0:20:44.190
you as you need and getting good at zoom

0:20:40.920,0:20:47.330
and orbit is just as important as

0:20:44.190,0:20:50.010
actually succeeding with the tutorial

0:20:47.330,0:20:52.380
the last one needs to go in multiple

0:20:50.010,0:20:53.850
directions multiple directions I'm fine

0:20:52.380,0:20:56.220
with whatever you want to do to solve it

0:20:53.850,0:20:59.220
you could grab on each black handle one

0:20:56.220,0:21:01.260
by one or just to kind of because it's

0:20:59.220,0:21:03.210
different I will choose to use the white

0:21:01.260,0:21:06.630
format handle this time so I'm going to

0:21:03.210,0:21:08.220
put this corner right into that edge I'm

0:21:06.630,0:21:11.870
gonna jump around to the back of my

0:21:08.220,0:21:13.920
drawing using using my right mouse orbit

0:21:11.870,0:21:15.930
I'm gonna get myself to the right

0:21:13.920,0:21:19.770
position here and then I'm gonna grab

0:21:15.930,0:21:23.900
this handle and bring it this way and

0:21:19.770,0:21:27.450
you can see how if you do a great job of

0:21:23.900,0:21:29.220
getting Tori you can see things then

0:21:27.450,0:21:33.270
these these assignments become very

0:21:29.220,0:21:36.960
reason and so now I'm finished with this

0:21:33.270,0:21:39.840
one so if it all works I'm gonna hit

0:21:36.960,0:21:41.910
next these are the instructions which I

0:21:39.840,0:21:43.680
didn't really need and so I'm gonna hit

0:21:41.910,0:21:47.790
next again and I should get stars if

0:21:43.680,0:21:49.830
it's alright yes my stars they added the

0:21:47.790,0:21:51.240
star animation it does actually like

0:21:49.830,0:21:55.550
helps this it doesn't make you happy

0:21:51.240,0:21:59.880
when you see stars alright so that was

0:21:55.550,0:22:01.890
size it up I think that there's two more

0:21:59.880,0:22:03.960
so I think there's fruit bit and

0:22:01.890,0:22:08.010
Alliance is what I think is coming

0:22:03.960,0:22:10.650
alright grouping so grouping is an

0:22:08.010,0:22:13.110
important concept in Tinkercad so in

0:22:10.650,0:22:14.400
Tinkercad you can only make like you can

0:22:13.110,0:22:16.590
only add cylinders and

0:22:14.400,0:22:18.000
locks and things like this but I said

0:22:16.590,0:22:19.260
that hey we're gonna make like a rocket

0:22:18.000,0:22:21.750
ship or we're gonna make like a house

0:22:19.260,0:22:23.640
and sometimes you need things like group

0:22:21.750,0:22:25.980
together and also sometimes you need to

0:22:23.640,0:22:28.110
make holes and things and the way you do

0:22:25.980,0:22:30.420
that in Tinkercad is you take these two

0:22:28.110,0:22:33.240
parts like a cylinder and a square and

0:22:30.420,0:22:36.930
this cube in this case and you make them

0:22:33.240,0:22:38.190
into like one part right that's that's

0:22:36.930,0:22:40.920
what this tutorial is going to show us

0:22:38.190,0:22:43.320
and the way you do it is you click on

0:22:40.920,0:22:44.910
the objects you want to group so these

0:22:43.320,0:22:47.100
two things on the left are going to be

0:22:44.910,0:22:49.010
grouped together and so what you need to

0:22:47.100,0:22:51.630
do is you need to click on the cylinder

0:22:49.010,0:22:53.730
and then you need to hold down the shift

0:22:51.630,0:22:54.870
key so it says like there's a hint in

0:22:53.730,0:22:57.240
here about like how to hold the shift

0:22:54.870,0:23:00.030
key hold down the shift key and then

0:22:57.240,0:23:02.340
click on the other one right now when

0:23:00.030,0:23:06.240
you've selected them both it should say

0:23:02.340,0:23:08.370
like shapes 2 in here and it'll it'll

0:23:06.240,0:23:10.680
have like handles that are big enough to

0:23:08.370,0:23:12.780
good goal thing and what you want to do

0:23:10.680,0:23:14.880
is you want to group it together so I

0:23:12.780,0:23:17.490
click on this button up here which is

0:23:14.880,0:23:20.610
group now what it does when you make a

0:23:17.490,0:23:22.980
group is it takes those two parts and it

0:23:20.610,0:23:24.420
makes them the same color it also makes

0:23:22.980,0:23:27.450
it to where they're essentially just

0:23:24.420,0:23:29.220
like a single solid mass now mine turned

0:23:27.450,0:23:31.410
orange wait why did it turn orange I'm

0:23:29.220,0:23:33.480
if I do it differently like if I select

0:23:31.410,0:23:35.280
the cube and then I hold down shift I

0:23:33.480,0:23:37.530
select the cylinder and then I say group

0:23:35.280,0:23:40.110
it turns red right but it makes them the

0:23:37.530,0:23:41.670
same color by default by the way if the

0:23:40.110,0:23:44.310
same color thing bothers you you can

0:23:41.670,0:23:47.100
always change it after you make it click

0:23:44.310,0:23:48.960
on the color and then say multicolor and

0:23:47.100,0:23:52.680
then it'll go back to the multiple

0:23:48.960,0:23:55.680
colors that you originally but it is

0:23:52.680,0:23:57.570
still one piece right now grouping

0:23:55.680,0:23:59.820
solids is useful you'll use that

0:23:57.570,0:24:02.850
sometime but actually what's even more

0:23:59.820,0:24:05.280
useful is grouping things where one of

0:24:02.850,0:24:07.140
them is a hole and the other is a solid

0:24:05.280,0:24:09.330
that's how you drill holes and take your

0:24:07.140,0:24:10.620
pen I'm a neat system so you'll notice

0:24:09.330,0:24:11.010
that over here maybe you saw this

0:24:10.620,0:24:13.320
already

0:24:11.010,0:24:15.570
you can add solid pieces these are all

0:24:13.320,0:24:18.270
these or you can also add holes of

0:24:15.570,0:24:20.280
things also for any solid you add you

0:24:18.270,0:24:23.970
can make it into a hole so here they've

0:24:20.280,0:24:25.980
added two parts there is a cube and then

0:24:23.970,0:24:28.080
this cube has another part in it which

0:24:25.980,0:24:29.940
is a hole but they're two separate parts

0:24:28.080,0:24:32.039
but now watch what happens if I click on

0:24:29.940,0:24:34.230
this one hold down shift click on this

0:24:32.039,0:24:35.610
one and then I click on this group

0:24:34.230,0:24:37.620
button which by the way is also

0:24:35.610,0:24:41.070
controlled G if you like short fakies

0:24:37.620,0:24:42.990
now once I do that I groups them and if

0:24:41.070,0:24:45.120
I rotate it I can see that I've just

0:24:42.990,0:24:48.269
drilled a hole straight through my block

0:24:45.120,0:24:49.799
right so that is how you do cutouts and

0:24:48.269,0:24:52.620
take a pad and it's actually a pretty

0:24:49.799,0:24:54.419
cool system by the way if you ever want

0:24:52.620,0:24:56.549
to ungroup something you can click on it

0:24:54.419,0:24:59.340
and you can click on ungroup I know have

0:24:56.549,0:25:04.289
your two two pieces back but that is a

0:24:59.340,0:25:07.799
group cool very useful take the guide

0:25:04.289,0:25:09.179
skill let's click on next and there's

0:25:07.799,0:25:12.620
more instructions here which we didn't

0:25:09.179,0:25:17.370
really need and then we get our stars

0:25:12.620,0:25:20.070
alright last one I think if it's not the

0:25:17.370,0:25:21.840
last one then you know we'll do more but

0:25:20.070,0:25:25.200
I'm pretty sure this last one this last

0:25:21.840,0:25:28.409
one is called alignment now aligning

0:25:25.200,0:25:31.110
things in Tinkercad I can be done a

0:25:28.409,0:25:34.799
couple of ways when we do our follow-ups

0:25:31.110,0:25:36.210
we'll do it like some manual ways but in

0:25:34.799,0:25:39.539
this tutorial we're going to learn about

0:25:36.210,0:25:41.669
like magically aligning things quickly

0:25:39.539,0:25:44.190
let's go ahead and learn more so here's

0:25:41.669,0:25:47.279
what we're gonna do the instructions say

0:25:44.190,0:25:49.919
to select all three boxes so click on

0:25:47.279,0:25:52.230
this box hold down shift click on this

0:25:49.919,0:25:54.750
box hold down shift and click on this

0:25:52.230,0:25:56.580
box and now what we want to do is we

0:25:54.750,0:25:59.159
want to pretend like we want these like

0:25:56.580,0:26:01.440
all be aligned like maybe vertically or

0:25:59.159,0:26:03.000
maybe I'll flap together no matter what

0:26:01.440,0:26:04.620
you want to do to align and you click on

0:26:03.000,0:26:09.090
this button right here this is a line

0:26:04.620,0:26:11.789
which is just L now with a line they

0:26:09.090,0:26:14.549
don't know how you want to align it so

0:26:11.789,0:26:16.049
maybe you want to align it until you

0:26:14.549,0:26:17.789
just use I'm just hovering I'm not

0:26:16.049,0:26:21.059
pressing any buttons maybe you want to

0:26:17.789,0:26:24.720
align it tour they're all like in the

0:26:21.059,0:26:27.779
same line this direction right so if I

0:26:24.720,0:26:29.490
click this thing here and you can see

0:26:27.779,0:26:31.860
what it would do is it would bring them

0:26:29.490,0:26:34.919
toward they're all in that plane right

0:26:31.860,0:26:37.500
if I clicked on this one here it would

0:26:34.919,0:26:38.850
bring them all over to this side if I

0:26:37.500,0:26:41.279
clicked on this one here and bring them

0:26:38.850,0:26:41.670
all to that side and you can see that

0:26:41.279,0:26:44.580
these little

0:26:41.670,0:26:46.590
black circles are hints for where you

0:26:44.580,0:26:48.120
could take things right and so it just

0:26:46.590,0:26:51.150
depends on what you're trying to do

0:26:48.120,0:26:52.320
which one you want in this tutorial what

0:26:51.150,0:26:54.690
they ask you to do is they ask you to

0:26:52.320,0:26:56.160
bring them all to the front so the first

0:26:54.690,0:26:57.750
black circle they want you to actually

0:26:56.160,0:26:59.400
click on is this one right here

0:26:57.750,0:27:00.570
I'm gonna click on this little black

0:26:59.400,0:27:03.060
circle and it brings them all to the

0:27:00.570,0:27:04.230
front by the way if you if you didn't

0:27:03.060,0:27:06.360
want to do something like you made a

0:27:04.230,0:27:10.170
goof undo always your best friend right

0:27:06.360,0:27:11.640
but I did want to do that and then after

0:27:10.170,0:27:13.620
I've aligned them this way the tutorial

0:27:11.640,0:27:15.330
says to bring them all down to the floor

0:27:13.620,0:27:16.650
together well if I wanted to bring them

0:27:15.330,0:27:17.970
all down to the floor together that's

0:27:16.650,0:27:21.150
going to be this handle over here

0:27:17.970,0:27:22.500
because it's gonna align them select you

0:27:21.150,0:27:24.360
can see this axes this will bring them

0:27:22.500,0:27:25.800
to the top bring them through the middle

0:27:24.360,0:27:27.540
and then that would bring them all to

0:27:25.800,0:27:31.430
the bottom one right so there's always

0:27:27.540,0:27:31.430
with a line there's like top middle and

0:27:31.580,0:27:36.930
so a line is something that we're going

0:27:33.900,0:27:38.610
to use at our tutorials together so I'm

0:27:36.930,0:27:40.860
going to go ahead and click on next to

0:27:38.610,0:27:43.700
see what instructions they've got and

0:27:40.860,0:27:47.670
sure enough I get my get my stars

0:27:43.700,0:27:49.380
so I'm gonna click on done now normally

0:27:47.670,0:27:51.750
here's where the next tutorial would pop

0:27:49.380,0:27:54.690
up but we have now finished all of the

0:27:51.750,0:27:58.920
tutorials I probably Kinley so that's

0:27:54.690,0:28:01.410
gonna be really loud so now we're ready

0:27:58.920,0:28:04.350
to like go back and make a new project

0:28:01.410,0:28:06.720
well whenever I click that button it

0:28:04.350,0:28:08.160
took me back to here and I didn't ruin I

0:28:06.720,0:28:10.290
don't really know where I'm at whenever

0:28:08.160,0:28:12.690
you're completely Rost click on the

0:28:10.290,0:28:16.710
Tinkercad logo and it'll kind of take

0:28:12.690,0:28:18.660
you back to your dashboard right so what

0:28:16.710,0:28:21.840
we want to do is we want to build a

0:28:18.660,0:28:23.610
rocket ship so here's a finished model

0:28:21.840,0:28:26.040
what we're going to build but of course

0:28:23.610,0:28:28.880
I don't want this I want a new design so

0:28:26.040,0:28:31.230
go ahead and click on create new design

0:28:28.880,0:28:33.540
now when you click on create new design

0:28:31.230,0:28:36.120
what it does is it picks a name for your

0:28:33.540,0:28:39.420
project and it saves it with that silly

0:28:36.120,0:28:42.000
name it's kind of fun to see what what's

0:28:39.420,0:28:43.590
the silly name is well I got a crazy one

0:28:42.000,0:28:47.720
there bodacious I don't even know how to

0:28:43.590,0:28:50.940
say it so I'm gonna call this rocket

0:28:47.720,0:28:52.830
it's not a rocket yet but it will be so

0:28:50.940,0:28:54.800
what I want to do is I want to draw my

0:28:52.830,0:28:59.150
rocket on this works

0:28:54.800,0:29:01.640
now my work plane right now is in

0:28:59.150,0:29:04.190
millimeters so you've got to get good at

0:29:01.640,0:29:06.500
different units so we work sometimes

0:29:04.190,0:29:08.929
millimeters sometimes here in the u.s.

0:29:06.500,0:29:10.820
we work in inches and there's lots of

0:29:08.929,0:29:13.730
different things and this platform right

0:29:10.820,0:29:15.470
now is 200 millimeters wide by 200

0:29:13.730,0:29:17.720
millimeters long that's actually a

0:29:15.470,0:29:20.540
little bit big for my rocket so if you

0:29:17.720,0:29:23.480
wanted to use a smaller grid click here

0:29:20.540,0:29:25.070
where it says edit grid and you can see

0:29:23.480,0:29:26.660
that right now it's using millimeters

0:29:25.070,0:29:29.600
but if you wanted to switch to like

0:29:26.660,0:29:31.760
inches or bricks you could do that and

0:29:29.600,0:29:33.190
the width is 200 by 200 what I'm going

0:29:31.760,0:29:38.000
to do is I'm going to change it to be

0:29:33.190,0:29:39.890
100 by 100 and you can have these point

0:29:38.000,0:29:42.170
0 0 or not they don't matter just so

0:29:39.890,0:29:44.840
long as it's 100 by 100 and when I click

0:29:42.170,0:29:47.480
on update grid it gets smaller and this

0:29:44.840,0:29:48.440
is a more appropriate size for the

0:29:47.480,0:29:51.110
rocket that we're going to build

0:29:48.440,0:29:53.090
together so the rocket then we're going

0:29:51.110,0:29:57.260
to build it's going to have a cylinder

0:29:53.090,0:29:58.700
as the like main fuselage and so you're

0:29:57.260,0:30:02.570
just going to go and drop a cylinder

0:29:58.700,0:30:05.360
onto your work plane I sometimes suffer

0:30:02.570,0:30:08.720
from OCD things I like for things to be

0:30:05.360,0:30:10.670
centered it doesn't actually matter in

0:30:08.720,0:30:11.660
fact I'm gonna be like re-centering and

0:30:10.670,0:30:14.390
all the time today

0:30:11.660,0:30:15.590
I just because it bugs me but really it

0:30:14.390,0:30:17.150
doesn't matter if it's centered so you

0:30:15.590,0:30:19.880
can see that when I brought dropped my

0:30:17.150,0:30:22.309
cylinder on here these blocks are each

0:30:19.880,0:30:27.110
10 millimeters like these major dividers

0:30:22.309,0:30:29.900
so this cylinder must be 20 millimeters

0:30:27.110,0:30:32.780
around it's radius is technically 10

0:30:29.900,0:30:35.179
millimeters and then it's also got some

0:30:32.780,0:30:38.300
height to it as well the height on it

0:30:35.179,0:30:39.650
right now is 20 millimeters let's go

0:30:38.300,0:30:42.020
ahead and change that let's make it a

0:30:39.650,0:30:45.530
little taller so to make it taller grab

0:30:42.020,0:30:48.350
this white handle and just grow it until

0:30:45.530,0:30:50.809
it's at 40 now I like to just grow it

0:30:48.350,0:30:52.940
until he hits 40 exactly but remember

0:30:50.809,0:30:54.950
that if you do gouf by one you say or no

0:30:52.940,0:30:57.530
hoops I like to know what 41 you can

0:30:54.950,0:30:59.330
always once you let go just click on the

0:30:57.530,0:30:59.870
number and then change it to what you

0:30:59.330,0:31:02.450
wanted

0:30:59.870,0:31:05.600
sometimes typing is actually easier than

0:31:02.450,0:31:08.509
getting at this perfect so here's the

0:31:05.600,0:31:10.459
fuselage of my rocket my rocket is

0:31:08.509,0:31:12.589
currently orange I personally I never

0:31:10.459,0:31:14.839
see rockets that are orange so I'm going

0:31:12.589,0:31:18.139
to change the color so click here where

0:31:14.839,0:31:21.469
it says solid and it's got the orange

0:31:18.139,0:31:23.809
color and pick a good rocket right

0:31:21.469,0:31:25.549
maybe this gray or maybe one of these

0:31:23.809,0:31:27.409
other degrees whatever you consider a

0:31:25.549,0:31:29.239
good rocket color if you like orange

0:31:27.409,0:31:31.129
rocket into a pink Rockets feel free to

0:31:29.239,0:31:34.070
make an orange repeat rocket but I'm

0:31:31.129,0:31:36.049
gonna make it so next thing I want to do

0:31:34.070,0:31:40.249
is I want a cone on the tip of my rocket

0:31:36.049,0:31:42.079
so I'm gonna drag a cone over now

0:31:40.249,0:31:44.539
whenever you first drag something into

0:31:42.079,0:31:46.639
your model you can try to put it into

0:31:44.539,0:31:48.079
the right spot but sometimes it's hard

0:31:46.639,0:31:50.059
right it's like I want to put it right

0:31:48.079,0:31:52.009
here on top well don't do that because

0:31:50.059,0:31:53.179
I'm what's gonna really happen is it's

0:31:52.009,0:31:54.979
gonna put it somewhere on your work

0:31:53.179,0:31:56.629
plane if I try to put it on top here

0:31:54.979,0:31:59.059
it's actually gonna put it way back in

0:31:56.629,0:32:02.449
the distance low cone so I'm just gonna

0:31:59.059,0:32:03.729
set it right up here right next to my

0:32:02.449,0:32:06.229
silver

0:32:03.729,0:32:08.629
now what I want to do here is I want to

0:32:06.229,0:32:11.179
somehow get it from here up to there

0:32:08.629,0:32:12.049
right so what I'm gonna do first is I'm

0:32:11.179,0:32:14.209
gonna move it up

0:32:12.049,0:32:15.469
it's kind of funny that it is a cone and

0:32:14.209,0:32:19.369
you have to grab the code but go ahead

0:32:15.469,0:32:22.489
and grab this cone and move it up 40

0:32:19.369,0:32:24.799
right so you can see that I'm moving it

0:32:22.489,0:32:26.959
up now I went off the screen here right

0:32:24.799,0:32:29.539
so I wasn't able to get to 40 but I can

0:32:26.959,0:32:33.289
always just click on the number it got

0:32:29.539,0:32:35.539
up to 37 and then I moved it up 40 so I

0:32:33.289,0:32:39.499
didn't change the height of the cone and

0:32:35.539,0:32:41.959
I just moved moved it up so you can see

0:32:39.499,0:32:44.059
that now it is been moved up it's the

0:32:41.959,0:32:46.669
same height as the cylinder which is

0:32:44.059,0:32:49.219
good now what I want to do is I want

0:32:46.669,0:32:52.549
them to be like on top of each other ah

0:32:49.219,0:32:55.129
that's where a line can be useful so I'm

0:32:52.549,0:32:57.589
going to click on my cylinder and then

0:32:55.129,0:33:00.079
I'm going to hold down shift and I'm

0:32:57.589,0:33:01.759
going to click on my code now what I

0:33:00.079,0:33:05.769
want to do is I want to align them a

0:33:01.759,0:33:07.969
line is a shortcut key that's up here

0:33:05.769,0:33:09.169
again if I work in a different pace than

0:33:07.969,0:33:10.399
you don't worry about it just go at the

0:33:09.169,0:33:13.249
pace that works for you but I'm going to

0:33:10.399,0:33:15.469
line them and I want them to be aligned

0:33:13.249,0:33:19.429
in two different directions I want them

0:33:15.469,0:33:21.759
to be aligned in this direction and in

0:33:19.429,0:33:21.759
this direction

0:33:22.100,0:33:28.990
and by doing that I put one perfectly on

0:33:24.830,0:33:31.370
top of the other now where it put it

0:33:28.990,0:33:33.890
perfectly on top of one another is not

0:33:31.370,0:33:36.080
the middle of the word plain that's fine

0:33:33.890,0:33:39.140
there's no reason to be in the middle or

0:33:36.080,0:33:41.179
plain except Frank can handle it so I

0:33:39.140,0:33:43.400
want to put it back to the middle now

0:33:41.179,0:33:44.960
for me to put it back to the middle I

0:33:43.400,0:33:47.750
think it's the easiest to do if I if I

0:33:44.960,0:33:49.730
view from the top so I'm going to choose

0:33:47.750,0:33:53.120
to click on the top on the view cube

0:33:49.730,0:33:55.039
here and it zooms me to the top I find

0:33:53.120,0:33:57.860
it's easier to do things from a top view

0:33:55.039,0:33:59.809
whenever I'm in the perspective mode so

0:33:57.860,0:34:01.580
I'm going to switch out of orthographic

0:33:59.809,0:34:05.960
and so projection mode just kind of like

0:34:01.580,0:34:08.330
makes it look flat which is nice and now

0:34:05.960,0:34:11.899
I'm going to choose to move my rocket

0:34:08.330,0:34:13.909
back to the middle to choose it I drag a

0:34:11.899,0:34:16.940
window around it and that'll select all

0:34:13.909,0:34:18.619
the pieces and then I'm gonna grab where

0:34:16.940,0:34:20.570
there's no handle so somewhere where

0:34:18.619,0:34:23.629
there's no handle and then that'll just

0:34:20.570,0:34:27.050
let me I drag it around I've got it

0:34:23.629,0:34:29.840
perfectly in the center again isn't that

0:34:27.050,0:34:32.480
better alright so now it's perfectly

0:34:29.840,0:34:34.639
centered and I'm gonna rotate it back to

0:34:32.480,0:34:38.540
where I can see it I'm gonna switch it

0:34:34.639,0:34:41.000
back into perspective mode cool

0:34:38.540,0:34:43.220
so our lock rocket is looking more and

0:34:41.000,0:34:46.040
more like a rocket it kind of looks like

0:34:43.220,0:34:48.790
a grain silo right now if you'd like to

0:34:46.040,0:34:51.109
change the tip of your rocket you can

0:34:48.790,0:34:53.359
mine is currently purple I've got no

0:34:51.109,0:34:55.700
problems with purple but I'll switch my

0:34:53.359,0:34:56.950
into a red you can make your rocket be

0:34:55.700,0:34:59.300
any color you'd like

0:34:56.950,0:35:00.740
so our rocket currently looks like a

0:34:59.300,0:35:03.800
grain silo the only thing we're missing

0:35:00.740,0:35:06.350
is we're missing fins right so we need

0:35:03.800,0:35:08.720
to thin this thing so it's kind of nice

0:35:06.350,0:35:11.330
to look around and see if there's any

0:35:08.720,0:35:13.790
tools that can kind of like help you

0:35:11.330,0:35:17.480
make fins so it looks like there's two

0:35:13.790,0:35:20.270
types of stars now you could use either

0:35:17.480,0:35:23.570
type of stars but I happen to know that

0:35:20.270,0:35:25.670
this blue one has more like features

0:35:23.570,0:35:26.780
that you can do the yellow one is a

0:35:25.670,0:35:29.630
five-pointed star

0:35:26.780,0:35:32.900
but this one has more features so I drug

0:35:29.630,0:35:34.470
the blue star and drop it over here

0:35:32.900,0:35:36.690
ah cool so

0:35:34.470,0:35:38.609
neat already all right so the first

0:35:36.690,0:35:40.950
thing I want to do with my star is I

0:35:38.609,0:35:42.990
want to change how many points it's got

0:35:40.950,0:35:45.150
right so this is kind of fun but you can

0:35:42.990,0:35:47.400
add as many additional points as you'd

0:35:45.150,0:35:50.849
like so it's kind of neat that you can

0:35:47.400,0:35:54.960
do that you can take it down as low as 3

0:35:50.849,0:35:57.300
I choose to have four fins on my rock

0:35:54.960,0:36:00.720
so I'm going to change mine to 4 if you

0:35:57.300,0:36:04.020
want a different number of fins on your

0:36:00.720,0:36:06.660
rocket that's just fine other things

0:36:04.020,0:36:08.910
that I can change is I can change the

0:36:06.660,0:36:11.550
radius I wanted my rocket down wider

0:36:08.910,0:36:13.619
fins or smaller fins to be honest I

0:36:11.550,0:36:15.750
didn't really want to change that so

0:36:13.619,0:36:17.490
here's what I do this is silly whenever

0:36:15.750,0:36:18.869
I change something on my go I didn't

0:36:17.490,0:36:21.930
want to change that I set it to

0:36:18.869,0:36:24.240
something outrageous and then I hit undo

0:36:21.930,0:36:26.250
and I set it to something outrageous so

0:36:24.240,0:36:27.780
that I can see when I hit on new that

0:36:26.250,0:36:30.840
it's actually back to what it was

0:36:27.780,0:36:33.500
supposed to be now what I do want to do

0:36:30.840,0:36:36.090
is I do want to kind of like thin up the

0:36:33.500,0:36:39.660
fins because like they could be like

0:36:36.090,0:36:44.040
super fat fins it's like they actually

0:36:39.660,0:36:44.940
look really pretty thin right the next

0:36:44.040,0:36:47.760
thing I want to do is I want to change

0:36:44.940,0:36:49.800
the color of my fins you could use

0:36:47.760,0:36:53.190
whatever color you wanted maybe you've

0:36:49.800,0:36:55.710
got black fins on your rocket I think in

0:36:53.190,0:36:59.040
one of my examples I used like an orange

0:36:55.710,0:37:01.020
bin whatever color fin you you'd like

0:36:59.040,0:37:03.720
and then the only thing I need to do now

0:37:01.020,0:37:05.490
is I need to align it with this other

0:37:03.720,0:37:08.130
one now there's a couple different ways

0:37:05.490,0:37:11.550
I can align it I could choose to select

0:37:08.130,0:37:13.849
it all and I could use the align again

0:37:11.550,0:37:16.080
if you want to do that go right ahead

0:37:13.849,0:37:18.119
or if you'd like to you can just

0:37:16.080,0:37:19.680
manually move it what I like to

0:37:18.119,0:37:21.720
sometimes do is I like to view it from

0:37:19.680,0:37:24.869
the top so I click on the word top here

0:37:21.720,0:37:26.400
on my view cube whenever I'm in the top

0:37:24.869,0:37:29.400
mode I like to switch to the

0:37:26.400,0:37:32.520
orthographic view and now I can take

0:37:29.400,0:37:36.119
this thing and I could just drag it to

0:37:32.520,0:37:38.040
where it is right in the center another

0:37:36.119,0:37:41.339
reason I chose to do that this time

0:37:38.040,0:37:43.050
instead of the align option is that I

0:37:41.339,0:37:44.580
happen to know that last time when I did

0:37:43.050,0:37:46.789
the alignment option I start to move it

0:37:44.580,0:37:48.380
later anyway I said those are

0:37:46.789,0:37:50.539
since my rocket now I think that they're

0:37:48.380,0:37:53.209
a little short so one thing that's nice

0:37:50.539,0:37:56.539
is I can still click on this object and

0:37:53.209,0:37:59.479
I can choose to make those spins taller

0:37:56.539,0:38:03.979
now the neat thing is is that stars

0:37:59.479,0:38:05.539
inside of the cylinder right but there's

0:38:03.979,0:38:08.119
nothing wrong with that it's just inside

0:38:05.539,0:38:11.150
and as far as CAD tools go they don't

0:38:08.119,0:38:14.539
care that it's overlapping so they're my

0:38:11.150,0:38:17.119
rocket is done you could you know change

0:38:14.539,0:38:19.099
the design however you see fit another

0:38:17.119,0:38:21.199
thing that you could choose to do is now

0:38:19.099,0:38:23.689
that it's kind of like a group you could

0:38:21.199,0:38:26.719
group so if you highlight the whole

0:38:23.689,0:38:28.579
thing there's two ways to do this you

0:38:26.719,0:38:30.319
can click and hold down shift and click

0:38:28.579,0:38:31.910
on each one individually that's fine but

0:38:30.319,0:38:34.099
I find that sometimes easier just like

0:38:31.910,0:38:36.799
drag a selection window around the whole

0:38:34.099,0:38:39.140
thing and you could choose to group it

0:38:36.799,0:38:40.999
if you would like now when you group it

0:38:39.140,0:38:43.640
it made it all the same color I

0:38:40.999,0:38:46.099
definitely don't want that so I click on

0:38:43.640,0:38:48.739
that color which is gray and I click on

0:38:46.099,0:38:51.919
multicolored and that lets it be a group

0:38:48.739,0:38:54.229
it's like it's a single group now but

0:38:51.919,0:38:57.319
it's different colors gold so there's

0:38:54.229,0:39:00.019
more things that you could do with your

0:38:57.319,0:39:01.999
rocket here but you now have a pretty

0:39:00.019,0:39:04.489
cool rocket one thing that's really easy

0:39:01.999,0:39:06.529
to do is you could duplicate it and then

0:39:04.489,0:39:08.539
now you have two rockets if you

0:39:06.529,0:39:11.119
duplicate it again now you have three

0:39:08.539,0:39:13.609
rockets and you know you could goof

0:39:11.119,0:39:17.079
around to your heart's content you can

0:39:13.609,0:39:19.099
choose to make Rockets bigger or smaller

0:39:17.079,0:39:20.749
one neat thing you can do with the

0:39:19.099,0:39:23.630
handles if you hold down shift when you

0:39:20.749,0:39:25.759
move it you could easily keep the

0:39:23.630,0:39:27.559
perspective the same so I just grab this

0:39:25.759,0:39:30.559
handle it does that but if I hold down

0:39:27.559,0:39:33.799
shift long move it it keeps it in the

0:39:30.559,0:39:35.929
correct perspective right well so I get

0:39:33.799,0:39:38.749
it to where you're happy with it I don't

0:39:35.929,0:39:41.359
really need all these extra rockets but

0:39:38.749,0:39:43.369
now I'm done my project and everybody

0:39:41.359,0:39:46.189
always asked this with Tinkercad how do

0:39:43.369,0:39:48.409
I save it and the answer is it saves it

0:39:46.189,0:39:50.569
for you right so it's just saved so you

0:39:48.409,0:39:55.130
can actually just go back to your kinker

0:39:50.569,0:39:57.709
dashboard and it keeps it saved alright

0:39:55.130,0:40:00.259
so let's start our last exercise for

0:39:57.709,0:40:00.470
today so the last exercise today is

0:40:00.259,0:40:03.710
we're

0:40:00.470,0:40:06.640
follow along with a link recent

0:40:03.710,0:40:11.060
Tinkercad blog post so this blog post

0:40:06.640,0:40:13.160
makes a house so what I'm going to do is

0:40:11.060,0:40:15.440
I'm going to kind of bring the tutorials

0:40:13.160,0:40:17.119
for this blog post up so that I can kind

0:40:15.440,0:40:19.130
of like jump back and forth between them

0:40:17.119,0:40:21.020
but if you want to you can just watch me

0:40:19.130,0:40:22.340
but you can see that he's gonna build

0:40:21.020,0:40:24.320
this house that's what we're gonna do

0:40:22.340,0:40:26.930
together and then once we're done with

0:40:24.320,0:40:28.880
that house we're gonna encourage you at

0:40:26.930,0:40:31.160
the end to make it your own right so

0:40:28.880,0:40:32.720
we're gonna go through his steps of

0:40:31.160,0:40:35.750
building the house and adding the roof

0:40:32.720,0:40:37.820
and then to make it your step is

0:40:35.750,0:40:39.290
something that you're going to do all by

0:40:37.820,0:40:42.260
yourself we're not gonna add piggies or

0:40:39.290,0:40:44.150
anything together right alright so go

0:40:42.260,0:40:46.820
ahead and go back to your dashboard and

0:40:44.150,0:40:47.660
click on create new design and so what

0:40:46.820,0:40:49.490
we're going to do is we're going to

0:40:47.660,0:40:51.140
build this house together and that's

0:40:49.490,0:40:55.040
gonna be our final exercise together

0:40:51.140,0:40:56.900
today so this house I guess technically

0:40:55.040,0:41:00.590
you could build it any size you wanted

0:40:56.900,0:41:05.359
but this tutorial recommends that you

0:41:00.590,0:41:07.609
make it a certain size 20 millimeters so

0:41:05.359,0:41:10.670
it's actually a very small house 40

0:41:07.609,0:41:12.320
millimeters and then 10 tall so let's go

0:41:10.670,0:41:15.859
ahead and start off by it by doing that

0:41:12.320,0:41:19.880
so I'm gonna go ahead and drag a block

0:41:15.859,0:41:22.670
over and what I want to do is I want to

0:41:19.880,0:41:24.800
make it 20 by 40 by 10 I'm there's all

0:41:22.670,0:41:26.570
kinds of ways to do that you could type

0:41:24.800,0:41:30.530
in those numbers over here if you wanted

0:41:26.570,0:41:33.140
or you could drag them with the handles

0:41:30.530,0:41:36.020
so I want one of the dimensions to be 40

0:41:33.140,0:41:41.300
I want one of the dimensions the height

0:41:36.020,0:41:43.700
to be 10 and I don't really care what

0:41:41.300,0:41:47.839
orientation you build it in right so you

0:41:43.700,0:41:48.950
can build it sideways like I did or or

0:41:47.839,0:41:50.960
the other way it doesn't matter

0:41:48.950,0:41:53.390
also notice that my grid is a little big

0:41:50.960,0:41:56.000
for this project as well I kind of like

0:41:53.390,0:41:57.650
for small projects to change my grid I'm

0:41:56.000,0:42:00.230
gonna do the same thing I did before I

0:41:57.650,0:42:05.270
clicked on edit grid and I made it 100

0:42:00.230,0:42:06.619
by 100 I had I updated it and so now

0:42:05.270,0:42:10.760
it's just kind of an appropriate sized

0:42:06.619,0:42:11.790
grid for one hour after being OCD I'm

0:42:10.760,0:42:15.210
going to move it to

0:42:11.790,0:42:16.860
but there's really no value in that and

0:42:15.210,0:42:18.900
I'm ready for the next step of the

0:42:16.860,0:42:20.460
tutorial so the next step of the

0:42:18.900,0:42:21.870
tutorial I won't bother to flip back and

0:42:20.460,0:42:24.090
forth to it it gets a little confusing

0:42:21.870,0:42:28.080
when I flip back and forth the next step

0:42:24.090,0:42:29.490
of the tutorial is to make a hole to cut

0:42:28.080,0:42:31.680
out the middle so that we can make all

0:42:29.490,0:42:33.870
four walls at the exact same time so

0:42:31.680,0:42:35.160
here's how the tutorial says to make a

0:42:33.870,0:42:38.820
hole one will do the same thing good way

0:42:35.160,0:42:43.140
to learn click on the block click on the

0:42:38.820,0:42:46.500
duplicate button so now this is sneaky

0:42:43.140,0:42:46.860
there's two blocks overlapping each

0:42:46.500,0:42:49.530
other

0:42:46.860,0:42:51.090
in the exact same space now how do you

0:42:49.530,0:42:52.230
how do you kind of know that I'll tell

0:42:51.090,0:42:53.550
you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna make one

0:42:52.230,0:42:57.330
of them a little taller than the other

0:42:53.550,0:42:59.430
and so I wanted to meet taller doesn't

0:42:57.330,0:43:02.070
matter how much taller and I'm gonna

0:42:59.430,0:43:05.190
take each of these sides and move it in

0:43:02.070,0:43:07.190
just one millimeter so you can see I

0:43:05.190,0:43:10.140
took that black handle I moved it by one

0:43:07.190,0:43:14.700
I'm gonna take this black handle and I'm

0:43:10.140,0:43:16.740
gonna move it in by exactly one and

0:43:14.700,0:43:19.050
you've got to get good at you know

0:43:16.740,0:43:21.000
rotating around and doing things I but I

0:43:19.050,0:43:24.150
want to take this back when I move it in

0:43:21.000,0:43:26.130
just one so now instead of 40 long it's

0:43:24.150,0:43:30.000
38 long because I took one off of each

0:43:26.130,0:43:31.830
side and then this is the the last side

0:43:30.000,0:43:34.890
over here I want to take this side yeah

0:43:31.830,0:43:40.620
one so you can see instead of being 20

0:43:34.890,0:43:43.800
wide it's 18 - I lost one so now I've

0:43:40.620,0:43:45.630
got two blocks now which is great but

0:43:43.800,0:43:48.570
this middle block I want to switch

0:43:45.630,0:43:52.500
instead of being a solid I want it to be

0:43:48.570,0:43:53.760
a hole so I click on hole and you guys

0:43:52.500,0:43:56.310
figured out what we're gonna do now how

0:43:53.760,0:43:59.970
to do and then I'm gonna take these two

0:43:56.310,0:44:05.040
parts my solid block in my hole and I'm

0:43:59.970,0:44:07.860
going to group I'm it's really neat when

0:44:05.040,0:44:09.600
you learn these skills and tutorials and

0:44:07.860,0:44:11.580
then you start like seeing them come to

0:44:09.600,0:44:13.590
life right so the easiest way to make

0:44:11.580,0:44:17.240
four walls is not to actually draw four

0:44:13.590,0:44:20.490
walls it's to draw one big box one hole

0:44:17.240,0:44:22.380
and then group them to subtract it out

0:44:20.490,0:44:25.410
pretty cool we're going to use that same

0:44:22.380,0:44:27.630
trick for the door so the dough

0:44:25.410,0:44:29.340
or and pause those you need if you're if

0:44:27.630,0:44:31.320
you're having trouble keeping up with me

0:44:29.340,0:44:35.550
no nobody at all the door is a

0:44:31.320,0:44:39.810
combination of a block which is huge and

0:44:35.550,0:44:42.630
a rounded roof so obviously they're

0:44:39.810,0:44:44.760
they're too big to start with but what

0:44:42.630,0:44:48.540
I'm gonna do is I'm going to assemble

0:44:44.760,0:44:49.920
them and then make them smaller so the

0:44:48.540,0:44:51.990
first thing I need to do to assemble

0:44:49.920,0:44:54.690
them as I need to put my blue roof up on

0:44:51.990,0:44:57.420
top of the house to do that I'm gonna

0:44:54.690,0:44:58.950
take my blue roof so I had this round

0:44:57.420,0:45:03.630
roof piece and I'm going to move it up

0:44:58.950,0:45:05.550
20 pixels so I'm dragging it up until

0:45:03.630,0:45:09.420
that gets to exactly 20 oh it's like

0:45:05.550,0:45:12.210
it's exactly 20 there and then I will go

0:45:09.420,0:45:15.330
ahead and click on this one and then

0:45:12.210,0:45:17.460
hold down shift and click on this one so

0:45:15.330,0:45:20.340
now I have only those two selected I

0:45:17.460,0:45:23.250
don't have my other things selected and

0:45:20.340,0:45:25.490
I do want to align them now so I'm going

0:45:23.250,0:45:27.840
to click on this align button up here

0:45:25.490,0:45:32.160
and I'm gonna line them in this

0:45:27.840,0:45:33.420
direction and that direction and the one

0:45:32.160,0:45:38.120
that should do is they should put the

0:45:33.420,0:45:38.120
roof right on the house which is great

0:45:38.330,0:45:42.630
now I'm going to shrink them down so

0:45:41.040,0:45:44.610
that the the right size for a doorway

0:45:42.630,0:45:46.710
but before I shrink them down I'm going

0:45:44.610,0:45:48.450
to group them so I've currently got them

0:45:46.710,0:45:51.000
both selected so I'm just gonna go and

0:45:48.450,0:45:53.610
click on the group button right now when

0:45:51.000,0:45:55.530
you click on group they become the same

0:45:53.610,0:45:57.270
colors whichever one you select it first

0:45:55.530,0:45:58.890
so in this case it will either be blue

0:45:57.270,0:46:01.500
or red depending on what you selected

0:45:58.890,0:46:04.230
first but it doesn't matter which color

0:46:01.500,0:46:07.800
was cuz we're gonna switch this thing to

0:46:04.230,0:46:10.040
be a hole right and the nice thing about

0:46:07.800,0:46:13.140
holes is they kind of show you the hole

0:46:10.040,0:46:15.450
so you can position it before you let it

0:46:13.140,0:46:17.340
go so we learned a lot of skills here

0:46:15.450,0:46:19.980
right we've learned about making two

0:46:17.340,0:46:23.100
objects we learned about aligning them

0:46:19.980,0:46:24.510
we've learned about moving them and now

0:46:23.100,0:46:27.780
what we're going to do is we're going to

0:46:24.510,0:46:29.250
position it so that it's a doorway well

0:46:27.780,0:46:31.440
the first thing I need to do to make

0:46:29.250,0:46:33.960
mine a doorway is I need to rotate it 90

0:46:31.440,0:46:37.050
degrees so that it becomes a doorway

0:46:33.960,0:46:39.060
that's just because of where I started

0:46:37.050,0:46:42.690
so I'm going to use my

0:46:39.060,0:46:44.430
rotate handles again I want to move at

0:46:42.690,0:46:46.740
exactly 90 degrees so I'm going to use

0:46:44.430,0:46:48.780
the inside the circle trick remember if

0:46:46.740,0:46:51.300
I was outside I could do like individual

0:46:48.780,0:46:53.100
degrees but I want to be inside the

0:46:51.300,0:46:56.880
circle so that I can easily move it

0:46:53.100,0:46:59.550
exactly 90 and then I want to make my

0:46:56.880,0:47:00.690
doorway quite a bit smaller so what I'm

0:46:59.550,0:47:03.840
gonna do is I'm gonna grab one of these

0:47:00.690,0:47:05.340
white handles and if I grab this white

0:47:03.840,0:47:08.010
handle on and move it you'll notice that

0:47:05.340,0:47:10.320
it just makes it like skinnier in one

0:47:08.010,0:47:12.240
direction but I want it to maintain its

0:47:10.320,0:47:13.740
proportions so I'm going to hold down

0:47:12.240,0:47:15.360
shift while I do it

0:47:13.740,0:47:17.640
and you'll notice that that

0:47:15.360,0:47:20.790
significantly changes how it behaves now

0:47:17.640,0:47:22.920
the whole thing grows proportionally I'd

0:47:20.790,0:47:27.030
shrinks I'm gonna actually shrink it

0:47:22.920,0:47:29.070
down where it's only four wide so it's a

0:47:27.030,0:47:30.450
teeny tiny door now in fact it's so

0:47:29.070,0:47:33.630
small that I lost my door

0:47:30.450,0:47:37.950
where are you doing and I'm going to put

0:47:33.630,0:47:41.070
my door to the front of my house cool

0:47:37.950,0:47:44.550
and being good at positioning I'm gonna

0:47:41.070,0:47:46.080
choose to get it perfectly centered so

0:47:44.550,0:47:48.510
you can see that now it's perfectly

0:47:46.080,0:47:52.170
centered in my house and now to actually

0:47:48.510,0:47:54.990
cut it out I select the the hole and I

0:47:52.170,0:47:59.000
select my part here and I group them

0:47:54.990,0:48:01.650
together that takes longer than I should

0:47:59.000,0:48:03.630
I'm gonna pause it I'm gonna go help my

0:48:01.650,0:48:05.130
camper and I imagine that you're gonna

0:48:03.630,0:48:07.410
need to help your camper a little bit as

0:48:05.130,0:48:09.720
well all right so I got my my camper

0:48:07.410,0:48:11.010
caught up there indeed there are a lot

0:48:09.720,0:48:12.960
of things here I think that I'm just

0:48:11.010,0:48:15.440
gonna let you work at your own pace but

0:48:12.960,0:48:19.160
just play until you get it working um

0:48:15.440,0:48:22.290
CAD modeling gets frustrating at times

0:48:19.160,0:48:24.060
but if you practice you'll get really

0:48:22.290,0:48:26.010
good at it and you get good at using the

0:48:24.060,0:48:28.110
mouse and you'll get rid of manipulating

0:48:26.010,0:48:30.270
things and this doorway is the hardest

0:48:28.110,0:48:32.040
thing we were doing today the last thing

0:48:30.270,0:48:34.560
we want to do is I want to add a roof so

0:48:32.040,0:48:38.340
I'm gonna grab a roof piece and drop it

0:48:34.560,0:48:39.780
on here I realized that my roof kind of

0:48:38.340,0:48:41.490
defaulted to the other direction as well

0:48:39.780,0:48:43.470
so I'm gonna rotate my roof this way

0:48:41.490,0:48:44.760
would have been easier if I just pick

0:48:43.470,0:48:47.730
the other direction but I didn't know

0:48:44.760,0:48:52.859
that at the time my roof what I wanted

0:48:47.730,0:48:56.039
to do is I want it to be 42 long so it's

0:48:52.859,0:48:59.069
just a little bit longer it's to longer

0:48:56.039,0:49:02.910
than the red that way it will kind of

0:48:59.069,0:49:05.099
overlap it and I want to make it 22 wide

0:49:02.910,0:49:06.859
because roofs always have a little bit

0:49:05.099,0:49:11.130
of an overhang right

0:49:06.859,0:49:14.609
so I took my rectangle I made it 22

0:49:11.130,0:49:18.420
by 40 the next thing I want to do is I

0:49:14.609,0:49:22.249
want to raise it up so I grabbed the

0:49:18.420,0:49:25.529
cone handle to raise it up 10

0:49:22.249,0:49:27.180
millimeters if only we're so easy in

0:49:25.529,0:49:28.650
real life to build things right you just

0:49:27.180,0:49:31.049
grab the roof and you just lift it up by

0:49:28.650,0:49:33.779
the cone right and then what I want to

0:49:31.049,0:49:36.779
do is I want to take this piece and this

0:49:33.779,0:49:38.849
piece and align them I so I can click on

0:49:36.779,0:49:40.289
the align button here I did that last

0:49:38.849,0:49:42.630
time and I certainly could do it again

0:49:40.289,0:49:44.460
but another way to do a lining that I

0:49:42.630,0:49:48.660
also like as I view it from the top I

0:49:44.460,0:49:50.970
put it in orthographic view and then I

0:49:48.660,0:49:54.380
just put it right right where I want

0:49:50.970,0:49:57.119
right so there it's right on the top and

0:49:54.380,0:50:00.239
then once I've got it where I want it I

0:49:57.119,0:50:03.569
switch back to the perspective view and

0:50:00.239,0:50:06.779
I can see that I now have a house pretty

0:50:03.569,0:50:08.730
cool if you would like just like we did

0:50:06.779,0:50:11.599
with the rocking you can optionally as

0:50:08.730,0:50:14.579
your last step select the whole thing

0:50:11.599,0:50:16.230
group that that'll make it the same

0:50:14.579,0:50:18.509
color but that's fine just click on the

0:50:16.230,0:50:22.289
color right here and say multicolor and

0:50:18.509,0:50:23.700
that's really optional because we're not

0:50:22.289,0:50:24.989
going to build any more of this and it

0:50:23.700,0:50:26.910
doesn't matter if it's one part or

0:50:24.989,0:50:30.960
multiple parts but I went ahead and made

0:50:26.910,0:50:33.930
it one part there I cool so there is my

0:50:30.960,0:50:36.839
house I consider that a finished product

0:50:33.930,0:50:38.430
I need to change the silly name they

0:50:36.839,0:50:42.029
they gave you here so I'm gonna call it

0:50:38.430,0:50:45.150
my house and that's actually where we're

0:50:42.029,0:50:48.029
gonna leave things for today if you

0:50:45.150,0:50:50.430
would like to try to make it your own

0:50:48.029,0:50:53.279
you can see that the person who created

0:50:50.430,0:50:55.410
this blog post went nuts he made all

0:50:53.279,0:50:59.400
kinds of things that's what I'd like for

0:50:55.410,0:51:03.059
you to do on your own so that's the end

0:50:59.400,0:51:04.690
of our day one I would encourage you to

0:51:03.059,0:51:07.930
try to build some things to make

0:51:04.690,0:51:10.420
get your own but that's the 3d modeling

0:51:07.930,0:51:13.390
tool in Tinkercad now this is actually

0:51:10.420,0:51:16.270
going to be our last day on 3d designs

0:51:13.390,0:51:19.089
right and so from here you've got enough

0:51:16.270,0:51:21.640
skills to play so just like as you think

0:51:19.089,0:51:22.900
of a project see if you can draw it but

0:51:21.640,0:51:25.660
you don't necessarily need more

0:51:22.900,0:51:27.339
tutorials from me I will say that you

0:51:25.660,0:51:30.819
might need to re-watch like some

0:51:27.339,0:51:32.530
tutorial things today or redo some of

0:51:30.819,0:51:34.210
those lessons so that you get really

0:51:32.530,0:51:35.950
good at those skills I've honestly I've

0:51:34.210,0:51:37.510
done those lessons like five times and

0:51:35.950,0:51:39.220
you can hit reset on them you can do

0:51:37.510,0:51:42.010
them again tomorrow we're gonna start

0:51:39.220,0:51:44.770
working with circuits so I look forward

0:51:42.010,0:51:47.920
to to see new them McKinley did you get

0:51:44.770,0:51:50.650
a finished house built today so she's

0:51:47.920,0:51:53.829
she's doing pretty good I was like she's

0:51:50.650,0:51:55.750
deaf got her house here and she's just

0:51:53.829,0:51:57.700
trying to get the finishing touches

0:51:55.750,0:52:00.839
alright you have plans for how you're

0:51:57.700,0:52:00.839
gonna make your house even better

0:52:00.900,0:52:04.450
alright

0:52:02.109,0:52:07.240
Gold great work today I'll help you

0:52:04.450,0:52:09.840
