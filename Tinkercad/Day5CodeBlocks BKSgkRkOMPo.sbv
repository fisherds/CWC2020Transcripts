0:00:00.640,0:00:06.690
[Music]

0:00:04.009,0:00:08.790
hey hey welcome back you made it to the

0:00:06.690,0:00:10.290
final day so today we're going to do

0:00:08.790,0:00:12.059
something a little bit different we're

0:00:10.290,0:00:15.000
gonna deal with code blocks

0:00:12.059,0:00:17.220
so no more text-based programming as

0:00:15.000,0:00:18.779
always I'm here with my my faithful

0:00:17.220,0:00:20.850
keeper McKinley McKinley are you ready

0:00:18.779,0:00:22.470
for the final day yeah are you excited

0:00:20.850,0:00:25.170
to learn about code blocks instead of

0:00:22.470,0:00:26.430
text based programming yes she's had

0:00:25.170,0:00:28.560
about enough of that expertise

0:00:26.430,0:00:30.330
programming it's good for you to learn I

0:00:28.560,0:00:31.800
exposed to to you some I've been now

0:00:30.330,0:00:33.899
we're kind of going back to more block

0:00:31.800,0:00:36.570
these things so here's what we're

0:00:33.899,0:00:38.700
building today so this is block based

0:00:36.570,0:00:39.930
coding kind of like scratch or tinker or

0:00:38.700,0:00:42.690
something like that so you're gonna drag

0:00:39.930,0:00:44.550
over code from like a tool box so it's

0:00:42.690,0:00:45.780
somewhere in that regard but the thing

0:00:44.550,0:00:48.180
that you're doing with that code is

0:00:45.780,0:00:49.410
you're building 3d models with it so the

0:00:48.180,0:00:51.510
thing that we're gonna do first is we're

0:00:49.410,0:00:53.640
gonna build the rocket so that's the

0:00:51.510,0:00:55.680
same thing that we built with the 3d

0:00:53.640,0:00:57.120
modeler on the first day but now we're

0:00:55.680,0:00:59.520
going to build it in a totally different

0:00:57.120,0:01:01.500
way you can also do like silly little

0:00:59.520,0:01:03.719
animations and things with it if you

0:01:01.500,0:01:05.939
would like right that's gonna be the

0:01:03.719,0:01:07.470
first example we do together and then

0:01:05.939,0:01:11.220
the next one's gonna be a more complex

0:01:07.470,0:01:12.540
example we're gonna build a trophy which

0:01:11.220,0:01:13.710
would be kind of interesting so you can

0:01:12.540,0:01:15.119
see it makes kind of a little animation

0:01:13.710,0:01:17.670
of all the steps we're gonna do here

0:01:15.119,0:01:19.439
it's actually a pretty complex design

0:01:17.670,0:01:21.119
but we're gonna do it together

0:01:19.439,0:01:25.380
but I thought I'd show you kind of one

0:01:21.119,0:01:28.049
easy on one complex design another thing

0:01:25.380,0:01:31.340
I'll say about 3d parts which is fun is

0:01:28.049,0:01:34.350
if you have access to a 3d printer or

0:01:31.340,0:01:36.360
you would like to order it online you

0:01:34.350,0:01:38.670
can actually print your 3d parts so I

0:01:36.360,0:01:40.890
have access to a 3d printer I will tell

0:01:38.670,0:01:42.540
them and so I printed this right so it's

0:01:40.890,0:01:44.009
a trophy it actually says Dave Fischer

0:01:42.540,0:01:46.740
on here I doubt you can see the letters

0:01:44.009,0:01:48.479
very well but it's fun to be able to

0:01:46.740,0:01:50.130
print things just to kind of know that

0:01:48.479,0:01:51.659
you can do that what I actually had to

0:01:50.130,0:01:55.259
do to print it is I actually had to

0:01:51.659,0:01:57.240
export this one as a perk file and then

0:01:55.259,0:01:59.689
I opened it up in the 3d modeler and

0:01:57.240,0:02:02.880
then from here it's pretty easy to

0:01:59.689,0:02:03.899
export an STL file that's if you're

0:02:02.880,0:02:07.979
printing it yourself

0:02:03.899,0:02:09.690
or you can click on 3d print and you can

0:02:07.979,0:02:11.910
actually like send it to one

0:02:09.690,0:02:13.320
companies like print the thing or

0:02:11.910,0:02:14.700
something like that and they will print

0:02:13.320,0:02:15.990
it for you and then mail it to you

0:02:14.700,0:02:17.610
obviously you have to pay for that

0:02:15.990,0:02:19.070
service but doesn't know that that's

0:02:17.610,0:02:21.420
something you could do if you wanted

0:02:19.070,0:02:24.840
alright so let's go and get started so

0:02:21.420,0:02:27.720
go to Tinkercad dashboard and go down to

0:02:24.840,0:02:29.910
code blocks my guess is that you don't

0:02:27.720,0:02:31.800
have any code blocks and yours I've got

0:02:29.910,0:02:36.000
a few in mind I said go ahead and click

0:02:31.800,0:02:37.980
on create new code block and like all

0:02:36.000,0:02:39.300
Tinkercad tools the first thing that's

0:02:37.980,0:02:41.330
going to happen is it's going to open up

0:02:39.300,0:02:44.970
your new project which would be blank

0:02:41.330,0:02:47.370
and it's got the new design as well here

0:02:44.970,0:02:49.320
and it's gonna give it some crazy name

0:02:47.370,0:02:50.310
right so we're used to the the crazy

0:02:49.320,0:02:52.320
name game

0:02:50.310,0:02:54.450
and so let's go ahead and fix the crazy

0:02:52.320,0:02:56.880
name to start things off I don't even

0:02:54.450,0:03:00.120
understand the name that I got today so

0:02:56.880,0:03:03.960
this is my rocket and if I wanted to I

0:03:00.120,0:03:06.030
could put in like a five rocket so

0:03:03.960,0:03:08.940
here's how code blocks works just like

0:03:06.030,0:03:10.620
scratch or tinker there's commands over

0:03:08.940,0:03:12.360
on the right there's different

0:03:10.620,0:03:13.260
categories for commands you can see

0:03:12.360,0:03:15.150
their shapes

0:03:13.260,0:03:18.330
there's modify there's control there's

0:03:15.150,0:03:20.910
math there's data there's markup and

0:03:18.330,0:03:23.520
then there's the area for your code kind

0:03:20.910,0:03:25.380
of like your your workspace and then

0:03:23.520,0:03:26.790
there's the stage over here this is like

0:03:25.380,0:03:28.800
you know your actors your performing

0:03:26.790,0:03:31.560
their their job so let's go ahead and

0:03:28.800,0:03:33.750
start off with a cylinder so go ahead

0:03:31.560,0:03:36.959
and drag a cylinder from the command

0:03:33.750,0:03:38.519
comet and drop it into your code and go

0:03:36.959,0:03:41.910
ahead and hit play just to see what

0:03:38.519,0:03:45.780
happens so what happens is this your

0:03:41.910,0:03:48.420
code says add cylinder the cylinder is

0:03:45.780,0:03:50.160
orange but if you change your code let's

0:03:48.420,0:03:52.830
say we wanted it to be a silver cylinder

0:03:50.160,0:03:55.610
I could change my code now it's a silver

0:03:52.830,0:03:58.170
cylinder you could also expand this out

0:03:55.610,0:04:00.300
and you could change the properties of

0:03:58.170,0:04:03.570
it so let's say I wanted a height of 40

0:04:00.300,0:04:07.050
for my rocket and if I change the height

0:04:03.570,0:04:09.030
to be 40 you can see that the cylinder

0:04:07.050,0:04:10.980
is about taller you can play with

0:04:09.030,0:04:12.150
different numbers if you wanted play

0:04:10.980,0:04:13.470
around to your heart's content with

0:04:12.150,0:04:15.930
changing the radius and the height and

0:04:13.470,0:04:17.640
things like that number of sides won't

0:04:15.930,0:04:19.620
really be a big impact you can see that

0:04:17.640,0:04:22.320
the cylinder is an approximation so it's

0:04:19.620,0:04:23.760
got 20 sides on it so it's not really a

0:04:22.320,0:04:25.860
perfect circle that's just how

0:04:23.760,0:04:28.350
Pro Grip work being play with radius in

0:04:25.860,0:04:31.130
high security code now you'll notice

0:04:28.350,0:04:36.330
that what it did is it put this cylinder

0:04:31.130,0:04:39.990
right at the middle so it's middle is at

0:04:36.330,0:04:43.230
zero zero zero so this red line right

0:04:39.990,0:04:45.720
here this is the x-axis this green line

0:04:43.230,0:04:47.430
right here this is the y-axis and this

0:04:45.720,0:04:49.920
blue line right here this is the z-axis

0:04:47.430,0:04:52.650
and put the middle of the park right at

0:04:49.920,0:04:55.860
zero zero zero so what I want to do for

0:04:52.650,0:04:58.950
my rocket is I want to move it up that's

0:04:55.860,0:05:00.900
a command that's in modified so it kind

0:04:58.950,0:05:03.810
of makes sense that shapes is where you

0:05:00.900,0:05:07.560
add new things and then modify is how

0:05:03.810,0:05:08.940
you you know modify them since it put

0:05:07.560,0:05:11.910
this thing right in the middle and it's

0:05:08.940,0:05:14.580
40 tall I want to move it up 20 in the Z

0:05:11.910,0:05:16.230
direction so if I run it now you can see

0:05:14.580,0:05:19.470
that it makes my cylinder and then it

0:05:16.230,0:05:21.420
moves it up 20 cool so let's go ahead

0:05:19.470,0:05:23.370
and do some more stuff by the way the

0:05:21.420,0:05:25.320
zoom features over here is the same as

0:05:23.370,0:05:26.670
it was from the first day you can hold

0:05:25.320,0:05:29.400
down the right mouse button to kind of

0:05:26.670,0:05:30.930
rotate around if you have a mouse you

0:05:29.400,0:05:33.300
can hold down the scroll wheel to kind

0:05:30.930,0:05:34.800
of pan around and you can also zoom in

0:05:33.300,0:05:37.050
and out with this protocol I do

0:05:34.800,0:05:39.690
recommend a mouse for this because it's

0:05:37.050,0:05:41.490
not 3d modeling but it's close

0:05:39.690,0:05:44.520
alright that's going to add the code

0:05:41.490,0:05:46.290
next so will kind of get used to this

0:05:44.520,0:05:48.810
pattern but if we want to add an object

0:05:46.290,0:05:51.600
that's a command that's up in shapes so

0:05:48.810,0:05:53.610
I'm going to add a code there's no harm

0:05:51.600,0:05:55.220
in just running it see what it does you

0:05:53.610,0:05:58.710
can see they put the code on down there

0:05:55.220,0:06:01.290
all right I want a different color code

0:05:58.710,0:06:04.110
you can pick any color you'd like I

0:06:01.290,0:06:06.540
think I'm gonna go with red ah the

0:06:04.110,0:06:08.340
height and the radius of the cone I'm

0:06:06.540,0:06:10.860
actually okay with so I think I'm just

0:06:08.340,0:06:13.980
gonna leave those alone but I do want it

0:06:10.860,0:06:18.960
to be red and then I do want to modify

0:06:13.980,0:06:22.470
it to where I move it up some so it's 20

0:06:18.960,0:06:23.790
tall so it must be at negative 10 like

0:06:22.470,0:06:27.560
the bottom of it's gotta be down at

0:06:23.790,0:06:31.410
negative 10 so I want to move it up

0:06:27.560,0:06:31.800
there is sometimes a little bug with

0:06:31.410,0:06:34.170
that

0:06:31.800,0:06:34.639
oh and that so what did I do wrong can I

0:06:34.170,0:06:41.629
move it

0:06:34.639,0:06:42.710
and what should I have done yeah I

0:06:41.629,0:06:44.120
should have moved it up all the way to

0:06:42.710,0:06:47.539
the top of the cylinder ten wasn't

0:06:44.120,0:06:50.780
enough I actually want to do 10 plus the

0:06:47.539,0:06:52.759
height of the cylinder so 10 plus 40 I

0:06:50.780,0:06:56.599
won't even bother asking Emily she knows

0:06:52.759,0:06:59.180
she can do that 50 cool and there I have

0:06:56.599,0:07:02.150
a little cone on top alright let's add

0:06:59.180,0:07:03.169
the fins so we're cruising along in the

0:07:02.150,0:07:07.039
easy way

0:07:03.169,0:07:09.590
so the fins are a star is what we put on

0:07:07.039,0:07:12.379
just like 3d modeling there's two

0:07:09.590,0:07:14.750
different stars there's this yellow star

0:07:12.379,0:07:16.909
which has to be five sided can't be

0:07:14.750,0:07:18.319
anything but five sided and it has to

0:07:16.909,0:07:21.349
kind of look like the picture there the

0:07:18.319,0:07:23.090
one we want is this blue star because

0:07:21.349,0:07:24.500
it's got all kinds of like bells and

0:07:23.090,0:07:26.569
whistles and features and things you can

0:07:24.500,0:07:27.590
change one thing you can change about is

0:07:26.569,0:07:30.080
of course the color

0:07:27.590,0:07:32.990
I feel like make a nice orange fins pick

0:07:30.080,0:07:35.750
any color you'd like but one nice thing

0:07:32.990,0:07:37.400
about this one is it defaults to five

0:07:35.750,0:07:39.800
sides so you kind of see that's what it

0:07:37.400,0:07:42.889
looks like with five sides but I choose

0:07:39.800,0:07:45.110
to have my rocket with four sides so I'm

0:07:42.889,0:07:46.940
gonna make a four-sided object

0:07:45.110,0:07:49.370
now there's other things that I like to

0:07:46.940,0:07:50.240
fix it looks like my fins are kind of

0:07:49.370,0:07:52.639
too fast

0:07:50.240,0:07:54.830
right so they're they're just a little

0:07:52.639,0:07:58.849
too fat in the middle that's the inner

0:07:54.830,0:08:01.460
radius percentage instead of point zero

0:07:58.849,0:08:01.940
five or sorry incident with zero point

0:08:01.460,0:08:03.319
five

0:08:01.940,0:08:05.839
I'm going to use something smaller

0:08:03.319,0:08:10.009
there's no magic answer here I'm going

0:08:05.839,0:08:12.949
to use 0.15 so that'll kind of look more

0:08:10.009,0:08:15.050
like things so that's good I also

0:08:12.949,0:08:16.580
learned to be quite a bit taller right

0:08:15.050,0:08:21.589
now their height this 10 I'm gonna make

0:08:16.580,0:08:24.379
their height to be 40 so I run it and so

0:08:21.589,0:08:25.389
now their height this 40 cool and so

0:08:24.379,0:08:27.949
it's going pretty good

0:08:25.389,0:08:29.870
what I need to do next is I need to move

0:08:27.949,0:08:31.279
it up into position and I think this is

0:08:29.870,0:08:32.810
the one that has the weird little blog

0:08:31.279,0:08:35.719
as far as the height I'll just try it

0:08:32.810,0:08:38.149
and see what see what happens so to move

0:08:35.719,0:08:41.029
this up into position what I want to do

0:08:38.149,0:08:43.940
is its height this 40 so it should be a

0:08:41.029,0:08:47.240
movement up of 20 I'm not sure if that

0:08:43.940,0:08:48.950
works so I try it here yeah and then a

0:08:47.240,0:08:51.500
weird little bug

0:08:48.950,0:08:53.060
move you're too tall I I don't know what

0:08:51.500,0:08:54.860
to say about that maybe it'll be fixed

0:08:53.060,0:08:56.660
by the time you get to it and that would

0:08:54.860,0:09:00.380
be great but it moved it five too much

0:08:56.660,0:09:02.450
so I only want to move it 15 sometimes

0:09:00.380,0:09:05.090
in programming I can make sense of why

0:09:02.450,0:09:07.610
things happen sometimes I just change it

0:09:05.090,0:09:10.940
to do what I want right but there is a

0:09:07.610,0:09:13.040
pretty cool little rocket so we did that

0:09:10.940,0:09:15.110
quickly but the nice thing about block

0:09:13.040,0:09:16.760
based coding is you can just see my code

0:09:15.110,0:09:20.300
right so it's just sitting right here

0:09:16.760,0:09:22.910
and so you can keep messing with yours

0:09:20.300,0:09:24.590
until you make it look like mine so

0:09:22.910,0:09:26.210
that's kind of the end of the rocket but

0:09:24.590,0:09:27.650
we're gonna do a couple extra things

0:09:26.210,0:09:30.080
with it just to kind of show you some

0:09:27.650,0:09:33.440
ways so here's what we're gonna do first

0:09:30.080,0:09:35.690
all these parts are really kind of part

0:09:33.440,0:09:37.760
of a group right and so you'll notice

0:09:35.690,0:09:40.520
that whenever I say move it just applies

0:09:37.760,0:09:41.960
to the last shape but if I wanted to do

0:09:40.520,0:09:44.450
something that applied to all of the

0:09:41.960,0:09:45.650
shapes I could make them into a group so

0:09:44.450,0:09:48.110
here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna click

0:09:45.650,0:09:51.410
on create group and I'm gonna put it on

0:09:48.110,0:09:53.390
here normally create group like in

0:09:51.410,0:09:56.150
regular 3d modeling would make them all

0:09:53.390,0:09:58.580
the same color but the default in blocks

0:09:56.150,0:10:01.220
is to make them multicolored so that

0:09:58.580,0:10:03.680
makes them a group now that doesn't

0:10:01.220,0:10:06.440
appear to have done anything at all but

0:10:03.680,0:10:08.600
it did and here's what it did now if I

0:10:06.440,0:10:11.150
do modify commands it's going to apply

0:10:08.600,0:10:13.280
to the whole group together so just for

0:10:11.150,0:10:19.070
fun what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a

0:10:13.280,0:10:21.770
loop that repeats four times and my goal

0:10:19.070,0:10:23.950
is to make this rocket kind of appear to

0:10:21.770,0:10:26.030
blast off right so it'll be kind of neat

0:10:23.950,0:10:29.600
and so here's what I want to do I want

0:10:26.030,0:10:33.140
to rotate and since I created a group

0:10:29.600,0:10:35.930
it's going to rotate my whole rocket I'm

0:10:33.140,0:10:38.630
gonna rotate about the x axis

0:10:35.930,0:10:42.380
which is right here and I'm gonna do

0:10:38.630,0:10:44.750
four rotations that are all 180 degrees

0:10:42.380,0:10:46.190
so that should basically be two flips so

0:10:44.750,0:10:47.380
we're not done yet but go ahead and run

0:10:46.190,0:10:50.480
it and see what happens

0:10:47.380,0:10:53.150
it builds my rocket and then it spins at

0:10:50.480,0:10:57.110
180 spin to 180 spin to 180 spin to 180

0:10:53.150,0:10:59.390
it's kind of interesting also I'll

0:10:57.110,0:11:01.640
mention that you'll notice that mine

0:10:59.390,0:11:02.380
runs at a certain speed that is based on

0:11:01.640,0:11:05.320
my computer

0:11:02.380,0:11:07.990
yours might run slower if yours runs

0:11:05.320,0:11:10.420
slower I recommend you you crank up the

0:11:07.990,0:11:11.800
speed to try and get it as fast as you

0:11:10.420,0:11:12.580
can you see if I crank up the speed it

0:11:11.800,0:11:14.860
goes too fast

0:11:12.580,0:11:18.190
the some computers do run faster slower

0:11:14.860,0:11:19.660
all right so it's almost done it doesn't

0:11:18.190,0:11:20.710
look like it's blasting off right now

0:11:19.660,0:11:22.960
though it just looks like it's like

0:11:20.710,0:11:25.090
spinning in place in order to make it

0:11:22.960,0:11:27.280
look like it's blasting off what I want

0:11:25.090,0:11:29.410
to do is instead of rotating about the

0:11:27.280,0:11:30.820
middle right here I want to rotate about

0:11:29.410,0:11:32.380
some point down here and then that way

0:11:30.820,0:11:34.210
it'll kind of look like it's kind of

0:11:32.380,0:11:36.370
blasting off and kind of like an art you

0:11:34.210,0:11:38.230
gotta go out of you and then it'll come

0:11:36.370,0:11:41.080
back again so I can blast off the second

0:11:38.230,0:11:44.290
time so what we want to do is we want to

0:11:41.080,0:11:46.330
change the pivot point of this rotate

0:11:44.290,0:11:48.030
about command and I want to make the

0:11:46.330,0:11:51.850
pivot point be somewhere like down here

0:11:48.030,0:11:53.380
so somewhere down here is this green

0:11:51.850,0:11:55.660
line that's the y-direction

0:11:53.380,0:11:58.300
so this is down like negative like I

0:11:55.660,0:12:00.340
don't know negative 150 in the Y that's

0:11:58.300,0:12:01.810
where I want to rotate around so I want

0:12:00.340,0:12:04.480
to drop something into this little

0:12:01.810,0:12:07.210
circle that says from pivot that's going

0:12:04.480,0:12:11.830
to be in math and here you can find

0:12:07.210,0:12:17.220
there's an X Y Z command and math and I

0:12:11.830,0:12:19.630
want to rotate around on negative 1 5 0

0:12:17.220,0:12:23.110
and so now if I run it it's gonna build

0:12:19.630,0:12:24.820
my rocket and so then it's gonna blast

0:12:23.110,0:12:26.770
it off and it's going to kind of loop

0:12:24.820,0:12:29.530
around and so depending on your on your

0:12:26.770,0:12:32.410
Vantage it'll look like a good blast off

0:12:29.530,0:12:33.910
or not I'll another thing I should

0:12:32.410,0:12:35.260
mention McKinley just had this book she

0:12:33.910,0:12:36.640
had her speed all the way up

0:12:35.260,0:12:38.320
I want your speed all the way up you

0:12:36.640,0:12:40.540
won't see an animation regardless of

0:12:38.320,0:12:42.370
your computer speed so make sure you put

0:12:40.540,0:12:44.110
it to the middle so that you can see the

0:12:42.370,0:12:45.420
animation even if your computer slow it

0:12:44.110,0:12:47.560
all will play the animation that way

0:12:45.420,0:12:49.660
another thing you can do which is fun

0:12:47.560,0:12:51.730
this again depends on your computer

0:12:49.660,0:12:53.230
speed you can click on share so I

0:12:51.730,0:12:55.660
clicked on share there and it kind of

0:12:53.230,0:12:58.420
fast but you can export this as an

0:12:55.660,0:13:01.180
animated gif file I don't know what you

0:12:58.420,0:13:03.670
know about gif files but their files

0:13:01.180,0:13:07.210
that are actually multiple images in

0:13:03.670,0:13:08.890
them and you can download an animated

0:13:07.210,0:13:12.040
gif file it takes a little bit to finish

0:13:08.890,0:13:13.930
but once you've got that file you can

0:13:12.040,0:13:15.500
like email that to other people and it

0:13:13.930,0:13:17.950
should kind of show the animation

0:13:15.500,0:13:21.380
Jaffar away from mine to finish here

0:13:17.950,0:13:23.690
alright so mine finished creating the

0:13:21.380,0:13:24.980
the jet file and I downloaded here now

0:13:23.690,0:13:27.950
what you can do if you wanted is you

0:13:24.980,0:13:29.750
could like email this jet file to

0:13:27.950,0:13:31.580
someone and be kind of fun so I took

0:13:29.750,0:13:34.430
that jet file I dropped it into this

0:13:31.580,0:13:36.230
email message and what a gift file will

0:13:34.430,0:13:39.050
do so I just said it to McKenna here

0:13:36.230,0:13:41.450
what a jiff file should do as it should

0:13:39.050,0:13:42.710
kind of play an animation to somebody

0:13:41.450,0:13:47.210
the team of it to you which is kind of

0:13:42.710,0:13:49.190
neat great alright back back to the the

0:13:47.210,0:13:52.250
goal the exporting can be fun you can

0:13:49.190,0:13:54.020
also export it as a part and then you

0:13:52.250,0:13:55.880
can open it over in the 3d model or

0:13:54.020,0:13:58.460
which is fun that's how you get things

0:13:55.880,0:14:01.580
printed as well alright so it's going to

0:13:58.460,0:14:02.360
open up a new project so that was the

0:14:01.580,0:14:04.970
easy one

0:14:02.360,0:14:06.320
I never comes the hard one right so I

0:14:04.970,0:14:09.260
thought we'd just do one hard one

0:14:06.320,0:14:12.320
together I thought it'd be fun to do a

0:14:09.260,0:14:13.700
trophy your last day of coding camp so

0:14:12.320,0:14:15.650
this is it you're making your own trophy

0:14:13.700,0:14:17.330
right so we don't give you a trophy are

0:14:15.650,0:14:19.820
you just gonna make your own either

0:14:17.330,0:14:23.030
couldn't say new design get yourself set

0:14:19.820,0:14:26.600
up with the new design as always there's

0:14:23.030,0:14:31.250
a crazy name up here so this is my final

0:14:26.600,0:14:33.260
trophy and so when I'm done with this

0:14:31.250,0:14:36.170
trophy is I've kind of figured out all

0:14:33.260,0:14:37.910
the dimensions in advance so I've kind

0:14:36.170,0:14:39.470
of got my notes here so we're gonna

0:14:37.910,0:14:41.060
cheat and we're gonna use some of my

0:14:39.470,0:14:43.250
dimensions that I kind of figured out in

0:14:41.060,0:14:45.170
advance but the way you develop these

0:14:43.250,0:14:46.970
things is little by little right so you

0:14:45.170,0:14:48.350
kind of you try a number you see how

0:14:46.970,0:14:50.150
that look so you just get down on paper

0:14:48.350,0:14:52.730
what you think it's gonna be I'm gonna

0:14:50.150,0:14:53.839
try it and it's this inner process of

0:14:52.730,0:14:55.850
like getting better and better and

0:14:53.839,0:14:58.570
better but we're gonna kind of jump to

0:14:55.850,0:15:01.250
the final answer just to kind of keep it

0:14:58.570,0:15:02.510
keep the video moving so let's go and

0:15:01.250,0:15:05.390
get started so what I want to do first

0:15:02.510,0:15:08.240
is I want to make this top cup so it's

0:15:05.390,0:15:09.740
like a cup that sits on top here the

0:15:08.240,0:15:12.410
part that's going to help me the most

0:15:09.740,0:15:15.770
with that is a paraboloid so I'm gonna

0:15:12.410,0:15:18.230
start by bringing over paraboloid this

0:15:15.770,0:15:20.630
paraboloid I choose to make it kind of a

0:15:18.230,0:15:23.780
gold color you can make it any color you

0:15:20.630,0:15:29.240
like and I want it to have a radius of

0:15:23.780,0:15:31.280
40 and a height also of 40

0:15:29.240,0:15:33.590
now if you run it right now it'll make

0:15:31.280,0:15:36.080
you're probably so you can look at it

0:15:33.590,0:15:38.720
it's kind of pretty on there it's upside

0:15:36.080,0:15:42.410
down and it's too low so I need to

0:15:38.720,0:15:45.080
rotate it so let's go ahead and click on

0:15:42.410,0:15:47.030
the rotate here I'm going to choose to

0:15:45.080,0:15:49.880
rotate it about the x-axis that's this

0:15:47.030,0:15:53.990
red line and I'm going to rotate it 180

0:15:49.880,0:15:57.020
degrees so now it's facing the correct

0:15:53.990,0:15:59.150
direction the next thing it is is it's

0:15:57.020,0:16:01.550
too low for me so I'm going to move it

0:15:59.150,0:16:06.410
up I know this is kind of a weird number

0:16:01.550,0:16:10.400
but I'm going to move it up 65 so what

0:16:06.410,0:16:13.700
that did is by being up 65 it made the

0:16:10.400,0:16:18.770
top of this thing via 85 so the height

0:16:13.700,0:16:21.440
is 40 half of 40 is 20 20 plus 65 is 85

0:16:18.770,0:16:22.790
so that's where it's at right there so

0:16:21.440,0:16:25.430
that's going good it's kind of a little

0:16:22.790,0:16:27.460
higher the next problem is it's not

0:16:25.430,0:16:30.500
actually a cup right it's just like a

0:16:27.460,0:16:32.780
solid thing so what I want to do is I

0:16:30.500,0:16:35.330
want to cut out the middle to make it a

0:16:32.780,0:16:37.390
cup well the way you can do that is to

0:16:35.330,0:16:39.650
add another paraboloid

0:16:37.390,0:16:41.870
except for instead of like setting a

0:16:39.650,0:16:44.240
solid color click on this button right

0:16:41.870,0:16:46.070
here which says to make it a hole so

0:16:44.240,0:16:48.470
this is going to make a cutout which

0:16:46.070,0:16:51.920
would be kind of neat now I want it to

0:16:48.470,0:16:54.470
be a little smaller than the original

0:16:51.920,0:16:58.430
paraboloid I'm going to make its radius

0:16:54.470,0:17:00.110
35 and its height 30 I know it seems

0:16:58.430,0:17:02.570
like I made that one 5 less than that

0:17:00.110,0:17:04.790
one 10 less but really the the diameter

0:17:02.570,0:17:07.610
is 80 over here for the diameter here is

0:17:04.790,0:17:10.310
70 so it's 10 less in diameter and then

0:17:07.610,0:17:12.680
the height goes from 40 to 30 now it

0:17:10.310,0:17:14.720
also is going to be upside-down I could

0:17:12.680,0:17:15.950
run it but I know that that's gonna be a

0:17:14.720,0:17:18.920
problem so I'm gonna have to flip it

0:17:15.950,0:17:21.620
over what the heck I will run it here

0:17:18.920,0:17:23.780
just so you can see it and then it's

0:17:21.620,0:17:26.390
also at the same also at the wrong

0:17:23.780,0:17:30.710
height so we need to move it up so that

0:17:26.390,0:17:34.130
it's top is also up here at 85 now to

0:17:30.710,0:17:37.840
get it to 85 it has a height of 30 so

0:17:34.130,0:17:37.840
we're going to need to bring it up 55

0:17:38.020,0:17:42.030
that right now it has a height of 30

0:17:40.340,0:17:46.110
which half of that

0:17:42.030,0:17:48.540
fifteen so to get it to 85 we have to

0:17:46.110,0:17:50.010
move it up to 70 and again the first

0:17:48.540,0:17:52.470
time I did this I didn't get it right

0:17:50.010,0:17:54.690
the first time I messed it up Buddha law

0:17:52.470,0:17:56.730
many times but you can play with these

0:17:54.690,0:17:58.350
numbers that's the fun thing about code

0:17:56.730,0:17:59.460
blocks you play with them and you see

0:17:58.350,0:18:01.770
what it does and you play with them and

0:17:59.460,0:18:03.600
you see what it does cool all right next

0:18:01.770,0:18:05.550
up I want to actually cut out this whole

0:18:03.600,0:18:07.380
in order to actually cut out that whole

0:18:05.550,0:18:10.260
it's the same as we did with 3d modeling

0:18:07.380,0:18:12.930
you create them as a group so I'm gonna

0:18:10.260,0:18:15.450
go ahead and round here and then as soon

0:18:12.930,0:18:17.850
as I say create group that actually kind

0:18:15.450,0:18:21.240
of like cuts out my hole so now I have a

0:18:17.850,0:18:22.950
cup which is pretty cool I next thing I

0:18:21.240,0:18:25.320
want to do is I want to have a stem

0:18:22.950,0:18:26.910
that's kind of below the cop so this is

0:18:25.320,0:18:28.470
gonna be my cylinder for the stem here

0:18:26.910,0:18:34.920
so let's go and see if we can make a

0:18:28.470,0:18:36.780
cylinder stem so I find a cylinder and I

0:18:34.920,0:18:38.280
choose to make it a gold color as well

0:18:36.780,0:18:42.420
again you can make it any color you'd

0:18:38.280,0:18:45.960
like I my stem that I'm gonna make I'm

0:18:42.420,0:18:47.280
gonna have a height of 40 that's kind of

0:18:45.960,0:18:49.830
want to use for my rock and I kind of

0:18:47.280,0:18:53.120
like forty twelve days now I'm gonna

0:18:49.830,0:18:55.560
need to move it up to position as well

0:18:53.120,0:18:58.200
and the thing that makes it kind of come

0:18:55.560,0:19:06.450
to the bottom look good is a move of

0:18:58.200,0:19:09.270
three I run that and so that'll kind of

0:19:06.450,0:19:10.770
like connect it to the bomb and again it

0:19:09.270,0:19:12.120
was just a guess in check until I

0:19:10.770,0:19:15.930
figured out that thirty was a good

0:19:12.120,0:19:19.650
height now it's off the ground some

0:19:15.930,0:19:21.630
amount it had a height of forty so that

0:19:19.650,0:19:23.400
half of that is twenty and then we moved

0:19:21.630,0:19:25.830
it up thirty so it's actually up above

0:19:23.400,0:19:27.480
the ground by ten right now so the next

0:19:25.830,0:19:29.430
thing that I put if I want to run it up

0:19:27.480,0:19:32.760
to the bottom of that I need to get it

0:19:29.430,0:19:35.460
to ten all right so I want to make this

0:19:32.760,0:19:37.830
block right here but up to the bottom of

0:19:35.460,0:19:39.090
that in my brain this is like a wooden

0:19:37.830,0:19:40.980
block so I'm going to make it kind of a

0:19:39.090,0:19:46.080
wooden color so what I'm going to do is

0:19:40.980,0:19:47.580
I'm going to add a rectangle box this

0:19:46.080,0:19:50.100
box I'm going to make kind of a wooden

0:19:47.580,0:19:51.240
color so kind of pick a brown again you

0:19:50.100,0:19:54.090
can pick a brown or you pick what

0:19:51.240,0:19:54.970
everyone and this thing I'm gonna make

0:19:54.090,0:20:01.450
90

0:19:54.970,0:20:02.830
line 30 in late and 10 in the height so

0:20:01.450,0:20:05.110
it's going to be 10 tall so it's going

0:20:02.830,0:20:07.620
to fill that gap perfectly now if it's

0:20:05.110,0:20:09.640
Tim tall I do have to move it up five

0:20:07.620,0:20:13.480
just so that it kind of comes up to

0:20:09.640,0:20:14.950
ground level by the way I wish that they

0:20:13.480,0:20:17.409
had just made when you put a block on

0:20:14.950,0:20:18.940
that it's bottom ones at zero but they

0:20:17.409,0:20:21.100
did it different maybe they'll change

0:20:18.940,0:20:24.460
the rhyme someday but you can see that

0:20:21.100,0:20:27.880
there I've got like a little block so

0:20:24.460,0:20:28.960
now I have the top part of my trophy and

0:20:27.880,0:20:33.070
it's going pretty good

0:20:28.960,0:20:35.169
now this trophy is not the finished

0:20:33.070,0:20:38.950
product so I want to take this whole

0:20:35.169,0:20:40.659
thing and move it up now as you can see

0:20:38.950,0:20:42.340
here is if I put on a move command now

0:20:40.659,0:20:43.809
it's just going to move the last shape

0:20:42.340,0:20:45.070
right that's how it works

0:20:43.809,0:20:46.870
okay each of these shapes is kind of

0:20:45.070,0:20:49.390
like a divider so what I'm going to do

0:20:46.870,0:20:52.299
if I want to move the whole thing up 100

0:20:49.390,0:20:55.059
I've got to make it a group so I'm gonna

0:20:52.299,0:20:57.039
create a group now and now that

0:20:55.059,0:20:59.559
basically says hey everything above me

0:20:57.039,0:21:04.240
is a group and I'm going to move the

0:20:59.559,0:21:05.799
whole darn thing up 100 and this is just

0:21:04.240,0:21:08.289
an amount so that it'll make room for

0:21:05.799,0:21:11.549
the rest of my trophy which is coming

0:21:08.289,0:21:15.190
below so there the whole thing moves up

0:21:11.549,0:21:18.429
cool so now I've got room for the middle

0:21:15.190,0:21:22.510
of my trophy the bottom wooden plaque

0:21:18.429,0:21:25.260
and then my name that's been as well now

0:21:22.510,0:21:28.299
I think this is like a pretty like

0:21:25.260,0:21:30.220
isolated chunk whenever you work in

0:21:28.299,0:21:32.289
bigger projects it's kind of nice to

0:21:30.220,0:21:34.179
keep your isolated chunks like separate

0:21:32.289,0:21:37.539
so here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna

0:21:34.179,0:21:38.440
grab this create new object I kind of

0:21:37.539,0:21:42.370
grew up with two of them there on

0:21:38.440,0:21:43.900
accident just a second I'm gonna say

0:21:42.370,0:21:47.770
create new objects and I'm gonna give it

0:21:43.900,0:21:50.919
a name we're going to call it top now

0:21:47.770,0:21:53.020
what does that really do it does a

0:21:50.919,0:21:55.020
couple things it makes this whole object

0:21:53.020,0:21:57.640
to be called top which is kind of nice

0:21:55.020,0:21:59.049
and if I ever wanted to duplicate it I

0:21:57.640,0:22:00.429
could do something like that sometimes

0:21:59.049,0:22:02.380
with code blocks you can duplicate

0:22:00.429,0:22:03.460
things easily but really what I wanted

0:22:02.380,0:22:06.820
to do is I just want to make this like a

0:22:03.460,0:22:07.870
single chunk of code so that I can start

0:22:06.820,0:22:10.480
working on something

0:22:07.870,0:22:12.850
now and I won't get messed up by the

0:22:10.480,0:22:15.370
food that was in here so this next

0:22:12.850,0:22:17.950
section I'm going to start with a create

0:22:15.370,0:22:23.409
new object and I'm just going to call

0:22:17.950,0:22:25.539
this one middle and these blocks kind of

0:22:23.409,0:22:27.070
help keep things isolated as well right

0:22:25.539,0:22:29.559
so now I don't have to worry about

0:22:27.070,0:22:31.900
interference between the top section I'm

0:22:29.559,0:22:34.270
in the middle section so for the middle

0:22:31.900,0:22:36.610
section what I want to do is I want two

0:22:34.270,0:22:37.659
cylinders and a bottom rectangle that's

0:22:36.610,0:22:40.899
going to be kind of like my middle

0:22:37.659,0:22:45.820
section so let's go ahead and do a

0:22:40.899,0:22:49.360
cylinder and just like before I kind of

0:22:45.820,0:22:54.029
like think of these as gold this

0:22:49.360,0:22:59.529
cylinder is gonna have a height of 80

0:22:54.029,0:23:01.000
and then I'm going to move it up into

0:22:59.529,0:23:03.190
position but I'm also going to move it

0:23:01.000,0:23:08.880
over so the value that I'm gonna move

0:23:03.190,0:23:11.710
this one is negative 30 30 negative 30

0:23:08.880,0:23:17.740
and the axe that moves it over to the

0:23:11.710,0:23:19.809
side and then six bolts all go and watch

0:23:17.740,0:23:21.070
my animation Banyon notice that I do

0:23:19.809,0:23:24.279
have to kind of wait for my whole

0:23:21.070,0:23:25.990
animation to finish if you ever get sick

0:23:24.279,0:23:27.610
of like watching your animation

0:23:25.990,0:23:29.520
feel free to crank the speed all the way

0:23:27.610,0:23:32.470
up and then depending on your computer

0:23:29.520,0:23:33.549
it'll build it out of faster speed with

0:23:32.470,0:23:36.309
no animation effect

0:23:33.549,0:23:38.890
alright see if you can pause the video

0:23:36.309,0:23:40.990
and look at the pattern we use for this

0:23:38.890,0:23:44.320
cylinder and make the cylinder for the

0:23:40.990,0:23:47.049
other side alright let's go ahead and do

0:23:44.320,0:23:51.270
the wooden block that's on the bottom so

0:23:47.049,0:23:58.539
we need a box and I think of it as wood

0:23:51.270,0:23:59.980
and this one is 120 wide 30 because of

0:23:58.539,0:24:02.350
link but I think that's kind of like the

0:23:59.980,0:24:05.529
depth and then the height on this one we

0:24:02.350,0:24:07.950
are going to use it 40 and then I'll

0:24:05.529,0:24:10.360
have to move that into position as well

0:24:07.950,0:24:14.140
since it's 20 tall I'm going to move it

0:24:10.360,0:24:17.169
up okay by the way if you get sick of

0:24:14.140,0:24:18.820
like the time needed to do things what

0:24:17.169,0:24:20.530
you can do is you can actually change

0:24:18.820,0:24:21.730
the order of your code if you want

0:24:20.530,0:24:24.100
so for example

0:24:21.730,0:24:26.250
I'm gonna show it a demo here for

0:24:24.100,0:24:29.650
example if this code is before that one

0:24:26.250,0:24:31.480
it'll show that one first right and so

0:24:29.650,0:24:33.280
if yours is running slow and it's kind

0:24:31.480,0:24:35.680
of annoying you can always do the thing

0:24:33.280,0:24:36.880
you care about most first and then put

0:24:35.680,0:24:38.110
the other stuff later and then you can

0:24:36.880,0:24:40.330
just pause it if you don't want to see

0:24:38.110,0:24:42.910
the later stuff right mine is still

0:24:40.330,0:24:46.420
running sufficiently fast so I don't

0:24:42.910,0:24:47.710
have a need to worry about it it's a

0:24:46.420,0:24:49.900
reset it here

0:24:47.710,0:24:53.080
and so if I want to I can just crank up

0:24:49.900,0:24:54.910
my superior it just gets done great so

0:24:53.080,0:24:56.680
that's the middle section now that

0:24:54.910,0:24:57.790
middle section is done I always kind of

0:24:56.680,0:25:00.190
liked it this is just personal

0:24:57.790,0:25:03.100
preference I always kind of like to end

0:25:00.190,0:25:05.410
these create new objects with a create

0:25:03.100,0:25:10.320
group at the bottom I just kind of like

0:25:05.410,0:25:12.580
to do it that way so now that section is

0:25:10.320,0:25:15.850
alright so the only thing we have left

0:25:12.580,0:25:18.730
is the tricky bit so this front namely

0:25:15.850,0:25:20.380
so I want to say your name and then I

0:25:18.730,0:25:23.770
want it to have kind of like a like a

0:25:20.380,0:25:24.850
gold plaque like pleat to it I saw what

0:25:23.770,0:25:27.220
we're gonna do is we're gonna add some

0:25:24.850,0:25:29.560
text and then we're gonna also have like

0:25:27.220,0:25:31.720
a gold plate to it now for this one I

0:25:29.560,0:25:34.260
will go ahead and put it at the very top

0:25:31.720,0:25:37.110
of my code just so that happens first

0:25:34.260,0:25:41.710
and I'm gonna give it a name

0:25:37.110,0:25:42.970
so this is my named Li you can spell the

0:25:41.710,0:25:45.190
name however you wanted I kind of did it

0:25:42.970,0:25:46.780
in a weird style there that's high name

0:25:45.190,0:25:47.380
my variable is what I could so I kind of

0:25:46.780,0:25:49.480
did it that way

0:25:47.380,0:25:51.340
name it whatever you want and the nice

0:25:49.480,0:25:53.980
thing about it being at the top is that

0:25:51.340,0:25:56.670
as I add things so first I'm gonna add

0:25:53.980,0:25:56.670
some text

0:25:57.010,0:26:03.340
and my text is gonna say D for sure but

0:26:01.060,0:26:05.350
since this is the very first thing in my

0:26:03.340,0:26:08.470
program what I can do is I can actually

0:26:05.350,0:26:10.270
just use this step by step button and

0:26:08.470,0:26:14.080
every time I click this step by step bar

0:26:10.270,0:26:16.450
um it does just one line of code so

0:26:14.080,0:26:19.570
that's another way that you can develop

0:26:16.450,0:26:21.730
big projects with code blocks right so

0:26:19.570,0:26:22.900
it did just that one step and then

0:26:21.730,0:26:25.660
whenever I want to run it again I just

0:26:22.900,0:26:28.210
reset it and I just step through kind of

0:26:25.660,0:26:30.670
one by one so what I want to do first is

0:26:28.210,0:26:33.400
I want my lettering to be black so I'm

0:26:30.670,0:26:35.470
gonna reset it and run through just two

0:26:33.400,0:26:37.059
steps

0:26:35.470,0:26:39.730
now you'll notice that there's not many

0:26:37.059,0:26:42.190
options on text there's how high do you

0:26:39.730,0:26:44.559
want it so that's the height here that's

0:26:42.190,0:26:49.480
the only thing you can really adjust I'm

0:26:44.559,0:26:52.360
gonna make mine be a height of 2 so that

0:26:49.480,0:26:55.000
way it's relatively flat it's not

0:26:52.360,0:26:56.500
completely flat like ink would be so

0:26:55.000,0:27:00.879
that if you do 3d print it you could

0:26:56.500,0:27:02.850
actually see like some bump now I also

0:27:00.879,0:27:06.759
want to shrink it down a little bit

0:27:02.850,0:27:07.929
my name is such that the amount I need

0:27:06.759,0:27:13.509
to shrink mine

0:27:07.929,0:27:17.620
is 0.65 I've done this before and I know

0:27:13.509,0:27:19.179
that 0.65 and the X 0.65 in the Y and

0:27:17.620,0:27:20.889
then there's no need to shrink the

0:27:19.179,0:27:23.110
z-direction that's the height so that

0:27:20.889,0:27:25.629
it's fine I happen to know that that

0:27:23.110,0:27:28.299
fits pretty well now if your name is

0:27:25.629,0:27:30.970
longer because it didn't mean to hit if

0:27:28.299,0:27:33.009
your name is longer you might need to

0:27:30.970,0:27:34.029
shrink it down more so for example my

0:27:33.009,0:27:37.000
daughter's name

0:27:34.029,0:27:38.860
McKinley Fisher is just a little bit

0:27:37.000,0:27:41.440
longer than mine she's got a shrink her

0:27:38.860,0:27:47.279
as more I've played with hers as well

0:27:41.440,0:27:50.620
and hers works pretty well at 0.5 0.5 so

0:27:47.279,0:27:55.509
think about your name think about if

0:27:50.620,0:27:57.220
it's longer than Dave Fisher if it's

0:27:55.509,0:27:59.649
roughly the length of McKinley Fisher

0:27:57.220,0:28:00.909
you'll meet about that if it shows the

0:27:59.649,0:28:02.440
name Fisher maybe you can make it a

0:28:00.909,0:28:03.909
little bigger don't go to much bigger

0:28:02.440,0:28:06.879
than my point seven or else it's gonna

0:28:03.909,0:28:08.139
go badly but that's a good skirt I'm

0:28:06.879,0:28:09.940
just going to leave it in as McKinley

0:28:08.139,0:28:12.850
Fisher I kind of like kind of like

0:28:09.940,0:28:16.179
seeing her name on there alright so the

0:28:12.850,0:28:18.639
next thing I want to do is I want to put

0:28:16.179,0:28:21.399
a rectangle below it right so I kind of

0:28:18.639,0:28:24.100
want to put like a backing plane so that

0:28:21.399,0:28:25.720
it kind of looks looks good so what I'm

0:28:24.100,0:28:29.919
gonna do for this backing plane is I'm

0:28:25.720,0:28:32.200
gonna make it related to this block down

0:28:29.919,0:28:36.100
here so this block down here is 120 wide

0:28:32.200,0:28:39.549
and 20 tall so the name plate has to be

0:28:36.100,0:28:42.580
a little bit less than 120 and a little

0:28:39.549,0:28:44.830
bit less in the height than 20 I'm going

0:28:42.580,0:28:48.630
to come down to pixels on all sides so

0:28:44.830,0:28:51.070
I'm gonna go with 118 and

0:28:48.630,0:28:53.140
maybe it's easier for me to just do than

0:28:51.070,0:28:56.230
to describe verbally so I'm gonna make a

0:28:53.140,0:28:57.400
block this is gonna be a gold nameplate

0:28:56.230,0:29:01.480
just for giggles I'm going to use like a

0:28:57.400,0:29:03.610
brighter Google and this nameplate needs

0:29:01.480,0:29:06.309
to have a height than a whip to it and

0:29:03.610,0:29:08.350
its width is gonna be 1:18 it's that way

0:29:06.309,0:29:12.570
it's two pixels less one on each side

0:29:08.350,0:29:16.090
than the piece of wood and then it's

0:29:12.570,0:29:19.299
length is gonna be 18 and then it's

0:29:16.090,0:29:22.900
height is gonna be 1 so those numbers

0:29:19.299,0:29:24.970
seem kind of crazy but what they do is

0:29:22.900,0:29:27.970
they give you a block that's kind of

0:29:24.970,0:29:29.950
like a nameplate that's roughly the

0:29:27.970,0:29:31.480
right size so when you put this

0:29:29.950,0:29:33.790
nameplate on now you'll know if your

0:29:31.480,0:29:37.030
name fits or not so looks like McKinley

0:29:33.790,0:29:38.919
Fisher it's pretty good but obviously if

0:29:37.030,0:29:41.470
your name doesn't fit now it's the time

0:29:38.919,0:29:43.809
to fix that scale so let's take a look

0:29:41.470,0:29:46.960
what we got here so if I rotate this

0:29:43.809,0:29:49.870
around I can see like a zoom like crazy

0:29:46.960,0:29:52.690
zoom in right I can see the one I've got

0:29:49.870,0:29:55.419
here is I've got a name which is too

0:29:52.690,0:29:57.580
tall and then I've got a name block

0:29:55.419,0:29:59.559
that's one call and so there's a little

0:29:57.580,0:30:01.150
bit sticking out on this side and a

0:29:59.559,0:30:03.280
little bit sticking out on that side I

0:30:01.150,0:30:05.140
don't really want a little bit sticking

0:30:03.280,0:30:08.110
out on each side so I'm gonna move that

0:30:05.140,0:30:10.570
name block down just a little bit so I'm

0:30:08.110,0:30:13.570
gonna move it down exactly one

0:30:10.570,0:30:17.260
millimeter so my Z is gonna be negative

0:30:13.570,0:30:19.090
one and so now it's good to be more

0:30:17.260,0:30:21.669
steps so now it creates the name it

0:30:19.090,0:30:25.900
shrinks it down I creates the the block

0:30:21.669,0:30:28.419
here and then here is the move down

0:30:25.900,0:30:31.720
right so it moves it down one pixel and

0:30:28.419,0:30:34.419
so now that lettering is all perfectly

0:30:31.720,0:30:36.910
on the top right cool

0:30:34.419,0:30:40.809
so it's going pretty good so at this

0:30:36.910,0:30:42.040
point I've got a name block now what I

0:30:40.809,0:30:45.280
want to do is I want to kind of like

0:30:42.040,0:30:47.350
rotate it up and move up forwards to the

0:30:45.280,0:30:50.919
front of the trophy since I want them to

0:30:47.350,0:30:53.350
move together the name and the back.you

0:30:50.919,0:30:56.140
piece I need to group them so I'm gonna

0:30:53.350,0:30:57.250
create group I can see the Kinley

0:30:56.140,0:31:00.669
struggling over here cuz there's

0:30:57.250,0:31:01.330
computers I'll help you out this so once

0:31:00.669,0:31:03.760
I group on

0:31:01.330,0:31:06.280
it's all one good that I need to rotate

0:31:03.760,0:31:07.900
them to kind of like flip them up I'm

0:31:06.280,0:31:11.320
gonna rotate them about this red line

0:31:07.900,0:31:13.480
here which is the x axis by 90 degrees

0:31:11.320,0:31:14.950
so I'm gonna see what that looks like

0:31:13.480,0:31:16.240
I'm gonna keep using my single step

0:31:14.950,0:31:20.560
approach even though it's getting kind

0:31:16.240,0:31:22.990
of long it's like I had to click a whole

0:31:20.560,0:31:27.610
bunch to go through create group there's

0:31:22.990,0:31:29.860
the rotate so now it is rotated up so

0:31:27.610,0:31:31.870
it's actually like almost ready to go

0:31:29.860,0:31:35.020
the only thing that's wrong is I need to

0:31:31.870,0:31:36.370
move it up some and forward some because

0:31:35.020,0:31:39.250
right now it's in the middle of the

0:31:36.370,0:31:41.800
trophy so this should hopefully be the

0:31:39.250,0:31:47.140
last thing I need to do I need to move

0:31:41.800,0:31:49.450
it forwards in the Y so the Y is this

0:31:47.140,0:31:50.680
green line here so if I want to move it

0:31:49.450,0:31:53.470
forwards on the Y that's actually the

0:31:50.680,0:31:57.370
negative Y direction and I'm going to

0:31:53.470,0:32:00.520
move it negative 16 the reason for the

0:31:57.370,0:32:04.510
negative 16 is because that wooden block

0:32:00.520,0:32:05.710
was 30 1/2 of 30 is 15 and then it has a

0:32:04.510,0:32:07.960
little bit of thickness as well so I

0:32:05.710,0:32:10.270
needed to bump it out to negative 16 I

0:32:07.960,0:32:12.010
also need to move it up in the Z

0:32:10.270,0:32:14.230
direction because you can see it's kind

0:32:12.010,0:32:16.090
of like partly below ground and I need

0:32:14.230,0:32:18.880
to move it up 10 so that it's in the

0:32:16.090,0:32:22.210
middle of that block so now I can do

0:32:18.880,0:32:24.940
eyes I can run my whole thing right so

0:32:22.210,0:32:27.550
it makes my name it makes the plate for

0:32:24.940,0:32:30.250
it it rotates it up it moves it into

0:32:27.550,0:32:33.690
position and then it starts creating the

0:32:30.250,0:32:37.120
the rest of the trophy

0:32:33.690,0:32:40.960
it's going pretty good and then the

0:32:37.120,0:32:43.480
block is over awesome now for your

0:32:40.960,0:32:45.040
animation if you want your animation to

0:32:43.480,0:32:47.770
happen in a different order you totally

0:32:45.040,0:32:49.840
can you can do it in any order you would

0:32:47.770,0:32:52.390
like to be perfectly honest so if you

0:32:49.840,0:32:55.860
want this to happen later you can just

0:32:52.390,0:32:57.940
very carefully move it later in the code

0:32:55.860,0:32:59.320
you can move it to the middle if you

0:32:57.940,0:33:02.980
wanted to right doesn't doesn't really

0:32:59.320,0:33:06.700
matter but if I run it now you can see

0:33:02.980,0:33:08.320
those the top thing first and then after

0:33:06.700,0:33:11.380
the top thing is done then it's going to

0:33:08.320,0:33:12.430
do my name plate second just showing

0:33:11.380,0:33:14.240
that you can do whatever order you want

0:33:12.430,0:33:18.070
and then it's going to do the

0:33:14.240,0:33:20.780
blacks and the blocks third pretty cool

0:33:18.070,0:33:23.090
would this have been easier to do with

0:33:20.780,0:33:25.400
the 3d modelers and blocks I don't know

0:33:23.090,0:33:28.700
it's really just kind of an opportunity

0:33:25.400,0:33:30.920
to learn how to use coding to do 3d

0:33:28.700,0:33:33.050
models from here what you can do is you

0:33:30.920,0:33:35.120
can export it if you have a 3d printer

0:33:33.050,0:33:38.179
you could get an STL file and you could

0:33:35.120,0:33:40.610
print it or if you wanted you could

0:33:38.179,0:33:44.059
export it as a part and then you could

0:33:40.610,0:33:45.470
just save the part to where you can edit

0:33:44.059,0:33:51.980
it somewhere else right

0:33:45.470,0:33:55.280
McKinley truth let me save that part now

0:33:51.980,0:33:57.980
I could also share it so I could make an

0:33:55.280,0:34:00.290
animated gif of it or screenshots those

0:33:57.980,0:34:02.360
are some things you could do if you did

0:34:00.290,0:34:05.059
choose to save it as a part what you

0:34:02.360,0:34:09.110
could do is you could now you can open

0:34:05.059,0:34:10.700
it in the regular 3d modeler if you

0:34:09.110,0:34:12.500
wanted to go that route so I'm going to

0:34:10.700,0:34:16.250
go ahead and show that step just just

0:34:12.500,0:34:20.030
for fun so in 3d designs I say create

0:34:16.250,0:34:22.250
new part and what I'm gonna do is I now

0:34:20.030,0:34:26.270
have that part in my library so it's

0:34:22.250,0:34:29.330
called my perk collection right so here

0:34:26.270,0:34:34.760
is McKinley's trophy that I made in

0:34:29.330,0:34:37.190
blocks we couldn't drag it over I drop

0:34:34.760,0:34:38.960
it right there cool and then once it's

0:34:37.190,0:34:40.790
in here you can do more things in here

0:34:38.960,0:34:42.859
if you wanted so you can kind of go back

0:34:40.790,0:34:45.440
and forth between these things and then

0:34:42.859,0:34:47.899
from over here you could actually like

0:34:45.440,0:34:50.359
get it 3d printed through one of these

0:34:47.899,0:34:51.560
one of these communities I haven't ever

0:34:50.359,0:34:53.389
done one of these because I don't need

0:34:51.560,0:34:57.020
to I've got access to a 3d printer but

0:34:53.389,0:34:58.730
no no the decatur right alright so I

0:34:57.020,0:35:01.790
finished the the rest of that kind of

0:34:58.730,0:35:02.930
quick McKinley I know you fell behind a

0:35:01.790,0:35:04.030
little bit you want to show the work

0:35:02.930,0:35:06.470
that you got so far

0:35:04.030,0:35:08.480
finish already finished you were able to

0:35:06.470,0:35:10.840
keep up with that that touring pace of

0:35:08.480,0:35:10.840
zing

0:35:11.020,0:35:15.530
so we'll see the the speed of the

0:35:13.340,0:35:18.440
Kinley's computer here so she's got it

0:35:15.530,0:35:20.000
set to max a little speed this is what

0:35:18.440,0:35:26.980
happens when your dad gives you a 10

0:35:20.000,0:35:30.800
year old computer right looking great

0:35:26.980,0:35:32.480
you got the bass on there and then right

0:35:30.800,0:35:36.020
now it's doing the McKinley Fisher stuff

0:35:32.480,0:35:38.810
and then it's going to pop right to the

0:35:36.020,0:35:43.810
front here just a second isn't it three

0:35:38.810,0:35:46.820
two one boom go I didn't like codeblocks

0:35:43.810,0:35:48.770
did you text based programming yeah

0:35:46.820,0:35:51.170
thanks mate for really is hard you enjoy

0:35:48.770,0:35:53.600
your code camp this week yeah thank you

0:35:51.170,0:35:55.880
so much for joining us thank you as well

0:35:53.600,0:35:57.440
for joining us today is been great

0:35:55.880,0:35:58.220
having you hopefully you've enjoyed the

0:35:57.440,0:36:02.270
camp

0:35:58.220,0:36:06.289
we'll see you some other time all right

0:36:02.270,0:36:06.289
