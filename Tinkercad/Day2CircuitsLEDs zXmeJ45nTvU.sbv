0:00:00.640,0:00:06.960
[Music]

0:00:04.640,0:00:10.160
hey welcome back uh so today is day

0:00:06.960,0:00:12.639
two of the tinkercad class uh i'm here

0:00:10.160,0:00:15.679
with uh with my student again

0:00:12.639,0:00:17.440
uh so this is uh mckinley you ready to

0:00:15.679,0:00:19.199
go today mckinley yep

0:00:17.440,0:00:21.199
all right we're gonna do some uh some

0:00:19.199,0:00:24.240
circuits today so

0:00:21.199,0:00:27.039
tinkercad um is built with

0:00:24.240,0:00:28.840
uh 3d model support so it's kind of what

0:00:27.039,0:00:30.240
we did yesterday with the rocket in the

0:00:28.840,0:00:32.800
house

0:00:30.240,0:00:34.800
it's built with circuits so you can do

0:00:32.800,0:00:35.680
things with like simulating circuits and

0:00:34.800,0:00:38.320
that's what we're going to do

0:00:35.680,0:00:39.920
today tomorrow and thursday and then

0:00:38.320,0:00:41.520
it's also got this new thing called code

0:00:39.920,0:00:43.520
blocks we'll do that on friday

0:00:41.520,0:00:44.960
so today we're going to go with circuits

0:00:43.520,0:00:46.399
i'm going to show you the solutions to

0:00:44.960,0:00:49.200
some things we're going to build

0:00:46.399,0:00:49.920
so we're going to build a pretty complex

0:00:49.200,0:00:52.879
program

0:00:49.920,0:00:54.399
just teasing that has an led so we're

0:00:52.879,0:00:56.800
going to show you the right way

0:00:54.399,0:00:58.000
to hook up an led with the resistor so

0:00:56.800,0:01:00.559
that you can turn it on and off

0:00:58.000,0:01:02.480
with this button um and that'll make the

0:01:00.559,0:01:03.039
led go on and off and then the wrong way

0:01:02.480,0:01:04.960
to do it

0:01:03.039,0:01:06.960
uh without a resistor and their little

0:01:04.960,0:01:08.960
simulator shows

0:01:06.960,0:01:11.119
disaster right so it explodes on you

0:01:08.960,0:01:12.560
right uh so that's one thing we're going

0:01:11.119,0:01:13.600
to build today another thing we're going

0:01:12.560,0:01:16.240
to build today

0:01:13.600,0:01:17.680
this is the main project is a stoplight

0:01:16.240,0:01:19.280
simulator

0:01:17.680,0:01:20.560
so i'm going to click on start simulator

0:01:19.280,0:01:22.799
here and so we're going to write code

0:01:20.560,0:01:24.880
for the stop cycle light simulator

0:01:22.799,0:01:26.720
and we're also going to build it in a

0:01:24.880,0:01:28.960
simulated environment

0:01:26.720,0:01:30.240
such that if you hit this push button so

0:01:28.960,0:01:33.280
i push this button button

0:01:30.240,0:01:34.159
my stop light goes green and then yellow

0:01:33.280,0:01:35.520
and then red

0:01:34.159,0:01:37.520
it goes pretty quickly just because it

0:01:35.520,0:01:38.960
makes the simulation work better

0:01:37.520,0:01:40.720
now the fun thing about what we're going

0:01:38.960,0:01:42.640
to learn today is these skills are

0:01:40.720,0:01:44.159
things that you could transfer to uh to

0:01:42.640,0:01:47.200
real products right

0:01:44.159,0:01:49.360
so i've got an arduino uno here

0:01:47.200,0:01:50.960
this one is part of a kit that comes

0:01:49.360,0:01:53.119
from sparkfun it's a pretty good kit

0:01:50.960,0:01:54.720
it's their sparkfun inventor kit

0:01:53.119,0:01:56.399
but i've actually taken the code that

0:01:54.720,0:01:58.399
we're going to write together and

0:01:56.399,0:01:59.920
put it on this real board and you can

0:01:58.399,0:02:01.920
see that when i push the button

0:01:59.920,0:02:03.920
it does the same thing on a real board

0:02:01.920,0:02:06.159
so everything that we're doing

0:02:03.920,0:02:07.520
in the simulator here is something that

0:02:06.159,0:02:08.319
if you happen to have the actual

0:02:07.520,0:02:09.759
hardware

0:02:08.319,0:02:11.120
you could totally build right so for

0:02:09.759,0:02:12.720
people that happen to have an arduino

0:02:11.120,0:02:14.959
sitting in a closet somewhere

0:02:12.720,0:02:16.080
uh they could do that by the way if you

0:02:14.959,0:02:18.239
did want to buy

0:02:16.080,0:02:20.000
an arduino you could look on amazon

0:02:18.239,0:02:22.000
there's some great kits out there

0:02:20.000,0:02:23.280
e lagoo has some cheap ones the spark

0:02:22.000,0:02:24.879
phone was also awesome it's just a

0:02:23.280,0:02:27.120
little more expensive

0:02:24.879,0:02:28.480
uh so let's go ahead and get started so

0:02:27.120,0:02:30.480
uh log in to

0:02:28.480,0:02:32.239
tinkercad uh hopefully you know how to

0:02:30.480,0:02:35.120
do that at this point

0:02:32.239,0:02:38.400
um and instead of being in the 3d design

0:02:35.120,0:02:40.480
area go into the circuits area

0:02:38.400,0:02:42.000
now when you come into circuits there

0:02:40.480,0:02:44.879
should be a

0:02:42.000,0:02:45.920
try circuits like tutorial here that you

0:02:44.879,0:02:46.879
can get started on

0:02:45.920,0:02:48.560
let's go ahead and go through that

0:02:46.879,0:02:50.720
tutorial it's only like three or four

0:02:48.560,0:02:52.400
parts this time so it's much shorter

0:02:50.720,0:02:54.080
if you don't have that tutorial you

0:02:52.400,0:02:55.840
could always get there via the learn

0:02:54.080,0:02:57.280
approach and like you could get there

0:02:55.840,0:02:58.640
but it should just be sitting right here

0:02:57.280,0:03:00.080
which is great i wish they did that for

0:02:58.640,0:03:00.959
the three designs i don't know what they

0:03:00.080,0:03:03.280
did they didn't

0:03:00.959,0:03:04.480
i would go and click on try circuits and

0:03:03.280,0:03:05.760
what it's going to do is it's going to

0:03:04.480,0:03:08.400
introduce us

0:03:05.760,0:03:10.480
to using circuits in a very brief

0:03:08.400,0:03:12.319
tutorial

0:03:10.480,0:03:15.440
so this is their first tutorial it's

0:03:12.319,0:03:17.920
very short it brings up a battery

0:03:15.440,0:03:19.519
this one is a coin battery i don't like

0:03:17.920,0:03:19.920
coin batteries they're too dangerous for

0:03:19.519,0:03:21.840
kids

0:03:19.920,0:03:24.000
but they work like any other battery

0:03:21.840,0:03:25.680
right and what this battery is doing is

0:03:24.000,0:03:27.200
it's going to light up an led when we

0:03:25.680,0:03:29.440
start the simulation

0:03:27.200,0:03:31.440
now let's talk about how this works so

0:03:29.440,0:03:33.280
we're looking at

0:03:31.440,0:03:35.519
um our project here so it's kind of the

0:03:33.280,0:03:37.120
middle area is your your board

0:03:35.519,0:03:38.799
uh and then over to the right here

0:03:37.120,0:03:40.959
you've got all your components that you

0:03:38.799,0:03:42.799
can add so you can bring components over

0:03:40.959,0:03:43.840
this one started with components so we

0:03:42.799,0:03:44.560
don't need to actually bring anything

0:03:43.840,0:03:46.159
over

0:03:44.560,0:03:47.760
and then over here is just the

0:03:46.159,0:03:49.120
information for this tutorial normally

0:03:47.760,0:03:50.560
there's nothing over here

0:03:49.120,0:03:52.319
and then once you're ready you can click

0:03:50.560,0:03:54.000
on start simulation

0:03:52.319,0:03:55.680
now start simulation is not that

0:03:54.000,0:03:56.080
exciting the only thing that happened is

0:03:55.680,0:04:00.000
this

0:03:56.080,0:04:02.000
uh led uh lit up right

0:04:00.000,0:04:03.599
and the reason it lit up is because

0:04:02.000,0:04:06.720
there is a loop

0:04:03.599,0:04:08.239
of uh electricity that actually is

0:04:06.720,0:04:10.720
flowing through this thing

0:04:08.239,0:04:12.959
so the battery has a plus here and so

0:04:10.720,0:04:15.920
this is the positive of the battery

0:04:12.959,0:04:18.239
it flows through a resistor the resistor

0:04:15.920,0:04:19.600
determines how bright the led is

0:04:18.239,0:04:21.440
and if you didn't have the resistor it'd

0:04:19.600,0:04:22.639
be too bright and it could damage the

0:04:21.440,0:04:25.919
led

0:04:22.639,0:04:27.440
and then there's an led and led has two

0:04:25.919,0:04:28.320
legs they're called the anode and the

0:04:27.440,0:04:30.320
cathode

0:04:28.320,0:04:31.840
i won't get into the chemistry of it but

0:04:30.320,0:04:33.520
but they're called anode and cathode for

0:04:31.840,0:04:35.199
chemistry reasons right

0:04:33.520,0:04:36.880
and so that that electricity flows

0:04:35.199,0:04:38.800
through uh the led

0:04:36.880,0:04:40.080
uh down through this black wire and then

0:04:38.800,0:04:42.479
back into the battery

0:04:40.080,0:04:44.560
and that loop is what makes the led come

0:04:42.479,0:04:46.000
on um now of course if there was a piece

0:04:44.560,0:04:47.280
missing from that loop like let's say

0:04:46.000,0:04:50.400
that wire wasn't there

0:04:47.280,0:04:50.720
uh you'd have no no loop uh no light

0:04:50.400,0:04:53.120
right

0:04:50.720,0:04:54.720
so it stops inflation cool and so the

0:04:53.120,0:04:55.360
only thing that this tutorial was trying

0:04:54.720,0:04:58.160
to show you

0:04:55.360,0:04:59.280
is how the environment works and to run

0:04:58.160,0:05:00.720
a simulation

0:04:59.280,0:05:03.120
and that's really it for the first

0:05:00.720,0:05:05.199
tutorial so i said that there are only

0:05:03.120,0:05:07.520
like i think there's four

0:05:05.199,0:05:09.120
and one of them is now done right so not

0:05:07.520,0:05:11.440
too bad

0:05:09.120,0:05:12.320
uh the next tutorial they've got uh is

0:05:11.440,0:05:15.600
actually

0:05:12.320,0:05:16.720
um is what inspires the uh the project

0:05:15.600,0:05:18.800
that we're building today

0:05:16.720,0:05:20.240
um it's to build a little traffic light

0:05:18.800,0:05:22.639
uh program

0:05:20.240,0:05:24.400
so here they're connecting to uh an

0:05:22.639,0:05:27.039
arduino uno

0:05:24.400,0:05:28.400
an arduino uno is a type of

0:05:27.039,0:05:30.160
microcontroller

0:05:28.400,0:05:32.400
microcontrollers are in everything like

0:05:30.160,0:05:33.600
if you press like a lock in your car

0:05:32.400,0:05:34.639
there's some microcontroller that

0:05:33.600,0:05:35.919
controls the signal

0:05:34.639,0:05:37.919
think of those like little bitty

0:05:35.919,0:05:39.039
computers and so we're going to be

0:05:37.919,0:05:40.880
programming

0:05:39.039,0:05:43.039
this microcontroller which is an arduino

0:05:40.880,0:05:44.960
uno to do things

0:05:43.039,0:05:46.720
and what we're doing here is we want to

0:05:44.960,0:05:48.400
make they'll show you a simulation

0:05:46.720,0:05:50.960
we want to make a little red yellow

0:05:48.400,0:05:52.560
green traffic light pattern

0:05:50.960,0:05:54.400
uh but right now you can see that all of

0:05:52.560,0:05:56.560
our leds are blue

0:05:54.400,0:05:57.600
and so the goal of this tutorial is

0:05:56.560,0:05:59.520
purely

0:05:57.600,0:06:01.280
to help you edit the components to

0:05:59.520,0:06:02.080
actually change these lights to be the

0:06:01.280,0:06:03.360
right colors

0:06:02.080,0:06:05.199
that's all they're doing in this but

0:06:03.360,0:06:06.400
we'll look at it a little more than that

0:06:05.199,0:06:07.919
so let's go ahead and follow the

0:06:06.400,0:06:09.440
tutorial and do what it says it says

0:06:07.919,0:06:12.160
click on the top led

0:06:09.440,0:06:13.759
all right and click on the top led and

0:06:12.160,0:06:14.800
then you'll notice that a little box

0:06:13.759,0:06:17.280
popped up here

0:06:14.800,0:06:18.800
and this little box has information

0:06:17.280,0:06:20.880
about this led

0:06:18.800,0:06:22.720
the most important thing is that it's

0:06:20.880,0:06:24.319
got a color

0:06:22.720,0:06:26.800
and we want to switch the top one to be

0:06:24.319,0:06:29.360
red now the second one down

0:06:26.800,0:06:30.000
if you click on the second one down it

0:06:29.360,0:06:32.560
is also

0:06:30.000,0:06:34.000
currently blue but as you can guess from

0:06:32.560,0:06:35.720
the wire color

0:06:34.000,0:06:37.120
uh we want to make it yellow

0:06:35.720,0:06:38.479
[Music]

0:06:37.120,0:06:40.400
the third one down hopefully you've

0:06:38.479,0:06:41.759
picked up the pattern is connected to a

0:06:40.400,0:06:45.120
green wire

0:06:41.759,0:06:47.039
and it is now green now this

0:06:45.120,0:06:49.120
circuit is actually very similar to the

0:06:47.039,0:06:51.199
one we saw before with the battery

0:06:49.120,0:06:52.800
but it looks more complex it's just that

0:06:51.199,0:06:54.080
the arduino here is better than a

0:06:52.800,0:06:55.039
battery because the battery is just

0:06:54.080,0:06:56.560
always on

0:06:55.039,0:06:58.479
whereas the arduino can make something

0:06:56.560,0:07:00.960
be on or off

0:06:58.479,0:07:02.479
and it fits right but pretend like this

0:07:00.960,0:07:04.160
is the battery for a moment

0:07:02.479,0:07:05.680
uh current is flowing through this

0:07:04.160,0:07:08.400
resistor uh

0:07:05.680,0:07:09.599
through this led uh and then to ground

0:07:08.400,0:07:11.360
and this ground is just kind of

0:07:09.599,0:07:13.520
connected between everybody

0:07:11.360,0:07:15.039
yellow is the same way flows through the

0:07:13.520,0:07:17.520
yellow and then the ground

0:07:15.039,0:07:18.400
and green is the same way and it flows

0:07:17.520,0:07:20.560
through here

0:07:18.400,0:07:22.400
now all they want you to do on theirs is

0:07:20.560,0:07:24.800
to change the color of the lights

0:07:22.400,0:07:26.400
and hit start simulation and then it

0:07:24.800,0:07:29.680
should go green

0:07:26.400,0:07:31.440
yellow red and then it just loops right

0:07:29.680,0:07:34.479
so it goes green

0:07:31.440,0:07:35.440
yellow red now that's all the tutorial

0:07:34.479,0:07:37.280
is going to have you do

0:07:35.440,0:07:38.800
uh i just want to glance at one more

0:07:37.280,0:07:40.160
thing before we move on

0:07:38.800,0:07:43.120
um and so i'm going to click on stop

0:07:40.160,0:07:45.280
simulation um and the way that this

0:07:43.120,0:07:47.280
whole thing works is via the code

0:07:45.280,0:07:49.520
that's on the microcontroller so click

0:07:47.280,0:07:51.840
on where it says code here

0:07:49.520,0:07:52.800
uh and you can see uh the code that they

0:07:51.840,0:07:54.319
wrote for this

0:07:52.800,0:07:56.560
you can see it a couple different ways

0:07:54.319,0:07:59.440
you can see it as blocks

0:07:56.560,0:08:00.240
blocks plus text or text uh what we're

0:07:59.440,0:08:01.840
going to do

0:08:00.240,0:08:03.520
um and i've done one done want me to

0:08:01.840,0:08:04.639
change it um what we're going to do

0:08:03.520,0:08:07.360
today is we're going to use

0:08:04.639,0:08:07.919
blocks plus text and what we're going to

0:08:07.360,0:08:09.759
do the

0:08:07.919,0:08:11.520
the two days after this is just straight

0:08:09.759,0:08:13.039
text so we're going to be programming

0:08:11.520,0:08:15.120
with just straight text

0:08:13.039,0:08:16.400
just to glance at it over here we're not

0:08:15.120,0:08:18.000
going to memorize it but i'm just going

0:08:16.400,0:08:21.039
to see some things it does

0:08:18.000,0:08:23.440
an arduino program

0:08:21.039,0:08:24.560
has two functions that get called one is

0:08:23.440,0:08:27.199
called setup

0:08:24.560,0:08:27.759
it does the setup work to prepare things

0:08:27.199,0:08:29.599
and then

0:08:27.759,0:08:31.039
loop uh this is a function that gets

0:08:29.599,0:08:33.599
called over and over again

0:08:31.039,0:08:35.599
that keeps going forever in a what's the

0:08:33.599,0:08:38.880
word sissy

0:08:35.599,0:08:39.839
forever loop yeah and so right now you

0:08:38.880,0:08:40.320
can see what they're doing is they're

0:08:39.839,0:08:43.440
making

0:08:40.320,0:08:45.600
the uh three leds red yellow and green

0:08:43.440,0:08:47.279
as output output and output so that's

0:08:45.600,0:08:49.279
part of the setup

0:08:47.279,0:08:50.320
and then in the loop uh they're doing

0:08:49.279,0:08:52.399
different things

0:08:50.320,0:08:53.600
uh so here they're making the uh the

0:08:52.399,0:08:56.720
green one on

0:08:53.600,0:08:59.279
so low low high

0:08:56.720,0:09:00.560
and then the yellow one on with a low

0:08:59.279,0:09:03.279
high low

0:09:00.560,0:09:04.080
and then the red went on with a high low

0:09:03.279,0:09:05.839
low

0:09:04.080,0:09:07.120
and then there's a little delay here

0:09:05.839,0:09:09.120
after each one

0:09:07.120,0:09:11.600
to make the simulation so like i said

0:09:09.120,0:09:13.040
we're not going to memorize the code

0:09:11.600,0:09:14.640
but i just wanted you to have some

0:09:13.040,0:09:16.800
appreciation

0:09:14.640,0:09:18.399
for how this thing works and the fact

0:09:16.800,0:09:20.399
that it's dealing with code

0:09:18.399,0:09:22.240
and code is going to be our whole focus

0:09:20.399,0:09:23.680
as we're working together

0:09:22.240,0:09:25.760
but let's get through the uh the

0:09:23.680,0:09:28.080
simulations uh the lessons first

0:09:25.760,0:09:29.200
so go ahead and click on next um and it

0:09:28.080,0:09:31.839
says that you can

0:09:29.200,0:09:33.920
change some things if you want uh but i

0:09:31.839,0:09:36.480
think that we'll do that together

0:09:33.920,0:09:38.160
so on to the next tutorial the only

0:09:36.480,0:09:40.240
thing i don't like about these tutorials

0:09:38.160,0:09:42.320
compared to the uh the 3d modeling ones

0:09:40.240,0:09:42.720
into the 3d modeling when you got stars

0:09:42.320,0:09:44.480
right

0:09:42.720,0:09:46.560
the stars went off you got this warm

0:09:44.480,0:09:47.200
fuzzy feeling uh where's this there's no

0:09:46.560,0:09:50.640
stars

0:09:47.200,0:09:52.720
do you miss the stars sissy all right

0:09:50.640,0:09:55.200
all right this next one is connecting

0:09:52.720,0:09:56.720
wires so a big part of wiring is

0:09:55.200,0:09:57.600
connecting wires

0:09:56.720,0:09:59.680
and what we're going to do is we're

0:09:57.600,0:10:01.040
going to connect two wires to this

0:09:59.680,0:10:02.079
circuit

0:10:01.040,0:10:04.240
and it shows kind of like a

0:10:02.079,0:10:06.880
demonstration of how to connect a wire

0:10:04.240,0:10:08.959
and so most of this circuit is all built

0:10:06.880,0:10:10.560
it does some crazy things with sound

0:10:08.959,0:10:13.200
i'll make sure my sound is cranked up

0:10:10.560,0:10:15.519
for this one it's going to be great

0:10:13.200,0:10:16.800
but it's missing two important wires the

0:10:15.519,0:10:18.079
wires that it's missing is the

0:10:16.800,0:10:20.000
connection to the battery

0:10:18.079,0:10:21.680
pretty important and so what they want

0:10:20.000,0:10:24.880
you to do is they want you to connect

0:10:21.680,0:10:25.839
the the red terminal of this nine volt

0:10:24.880,0:10:28.640
battery

0:10:25.839,0:10:30.000
up to the red line that's up here you'll

0:10:28.640,0:10:31.279
notice that if you look at their circuit

0:10:30.000,0:10:33.440
there's a red

0:10:31.279,0:10:35.200
plus rail and it's actually connected

0:10:33.440,0:10:36.800
all the way down

0:10:35.200,0:10:38.800
and then there's a red line which makes

0:10:36.800,0:10:40.959
it connected to the bottom um

0:10:38.800,0:10:42.720
plus rail down here as well uh we'll

0:10:40.959,0:10:44.320
talk about breadboards more but the

0:10:42.720,0:10:45.760
the rails that are on the outside are

0:10:44.320,0:10:48.079
connected all the way down

0:10:45.760,0:10:49.600
internally and rails in the middle are

0:10:48.079,0:10:52.640
connected all the way across

0:10:49.600,0:10:54.399
internally right so to connect a wire

0:10:52.640,0:10:56.800
most people they want to click click and

0:10:54.399,0:10:57.360
drag and that kind of sort of almost

0:10:56.800,0:10:59.760
works

0:10:57.360,0:11:01.680
but the best way to do it in tinkercad

0:10:59.760,0:11:02.560
circuits is to click once for where you

0:11:01.680,0:11:04.160
start

0:11:02.560,0:11:06.399
and then i'm no longer touching the

0:11:04.160,0:11:08.880
mouse and then to click again

0:11:06.399,0:11:10.320
when you get to here and so that

0:11:08.880,0:11:13.360
connects the wire

0:11:10.320,0:11:16.640
with two clicks is how it works best

0:11:13.360,0:11:19.519
now let's talk about colors so wires uh

0:11:16.640,0:11:20.000
you can change colors on wires uh the

0:11:19.519,0:11:22.959
color

0:11:20.000,0:11:24.480
of a wire is completely meaningless

0:11:22.959,0:11:26.240
right it's it's just like you spray

0:11:24.480,0:11:29.600
painted it red or spray painted blue

0:11:26.240,0:11:30.240
it does not matter at all i like to use

0:11:29.600,0:11:32.720
colors

0:11:30.240,0:11:34.720
to make my code easier to look at so for

0:11:32.720,0:11:36.320
example they used a red and a black here

0:11:34.720,0:11:38.079
and i just immediately knew hey one of

0:11:36.320,0:11:40.480
these is for the the positive

0:11:38.079,0:11:42.079
uh from the battery like the plus and

0:11:40.480,0:11:42.720
then the other one the black is for the

0:11:42.079,0:11:45.279
ground

0:11:42.720,0:11:47.279
so that's why colors are nice so we

0:11:45.279,0:11:48.640
connected that one

0:11:47.279,0:11:50.320
uh and then it says to connect the

0:11:48.640,0:11:53.040
ground one uh so this is the same as

0:11:50.320,0:11:55.519
what we did before so we click on

0:11:53.040,0:11:57.600
the black there and then you do have to

0:11:55.519,0:12:00.639
be careful about where it goes to

0:11:57.600,0:12:01.760
they want it to go to the black line on

0:12:00.639,0:12:03.600
the bottom

0:12:01.760,0:12:06.240
and then i choose to change that and

0:12:03.600,0:12:10.320
make it be a black wire

0:12:06.240,0:12:12.240
now let's try it

0:12:10.320,0:12:13.360
uh and if it works it should make a

0:12:12.240,0:12:16.560
bunch of noise

0:12:13.360,0:12:17.600
uh so mine uh thankfully uh isn't making

0:12:16.560,0:12:19.440
a ton of noise

0:12:17.600,0:12:21.200
uh because of the how my microphone's

0:12:19.440,0:12:23.519
set up uh but yours

0:12:21.200,0:12:24.320
uh yours should be making a bunch of

0:12:23.519,0:12:26.560
noise

0:12:24.320,0:12:27.030
all right sissies yours make a noise yep

0:12:26.560,0:12:29.040
okay

0:12:27.030,0:12:31.120
[Music]

0:12:29.040,0:12:32.079
all right so it makes some uh some

0:12:31.120,0:12:33.839
horrible noises

0:12:32.079,0:12:35.040
uh when you press the buttons uh so i

0:12:33.839,0:12:35.680
just realized i wasn't even pressing the

0:12:35.040,0:12:37.839
buttons but

0:12:35.680,0:12:39.360
when you press these buttons it should

0:12:37.839,0:12:40.560
be like a piano

0:12:39.360,0:12:43.040
and each one should make a different

0:12:40.560,0:12:44.240
pitch so it's a cute little way to start

0:12:43.040,0:12:46.639
learning about

0:12:44.240,0:12:47.519
doing some wiring but really we just

0:12:46.639,0:12:50.079
connected two

0:12:47.519,0:12:50.880
wires in the tutorial uh the next thing

0:12:50.079,0:12:52.000
we're going to do is we're going to

0:12:50.880,0:12:54.639
learn how to get like

0:12:52.000,0:12:56.399
fancier with adding wires and also to

0:12:54.639,0:12:58.480
add some components

0:12:56.399,0:13:01.440
so this circuit has two double a

0:12:58.480,0:13:05.040
batteries so that's about 3 volts total

0:13:01.440,0:13:07.200
driving a motor this circuit does work

0:13:05.040,0:13:08.800
you can go ahead and test it right now

0:13:07.200,0:13:09.760
and what it'll do is it'll spin this

0:13:08.800,0:13:11.519
little motor

0:13:09.760,0:13:13.120
so these are our pretty inexpensive

0:13:11.519,0:13:15.760
motors uh it's

0:13:13.120,0:13:17.120
cruising along at some super fast speed

0:13:15.760,0:13:18.639
it looks slow here

0:13:17.120,0:13:20.079
but it's just because it's going so fast

0:13:18.639,0:13:21.760
that it's messing with the frame rate so

0:13:20.079,0:13:23.720
it's going super fast right so these

0:13:21.760,0:13:26.320
motors has been at like

0:13:23.720,0:13:27.760
5902 rpms is what mine is doing right

0:13:26.320,0:13:28.800
now

0:13:27.760,0:13:30.000
and what they're going to do in this

0:13:28.800,0:13:31.600
tutorial is they're going to have you

0:13:30.000,0:13:35.200
add

0:13:31.600,0:13:37.200
a resistor what's called a photoresistor

0:13:35.200,0:13:38.959
instead of that bottom wire so go ahead

0:13:37.200,0:13:42.880
and do this click on the bottom wire

0:13:38.959,0:13:44.880
uh hit delete and then

0:13:42.880,0:13:47.120
in your component scroll until you find

0:13:44.880,0:13:50.800
a symbol that kind of looks like that

0:13:47.120,0:13:52.639
uh here it is so it's a photo resistor

0:13:50.800,0:13:54.880
all right so there's my photo resistor

0:13:52.639,0:13:56.639
uh and then what it tells you to do next

0:13:54.880,0:14:00.240
is it tells you to rotate it

0:13:56.639,0:14:01.760
um to rotate it you hit the r key

0:14:00.240,0:14:04.320
so if you hit the r key it'll kind of

0:14:01.760,0:14:05.519
rotate it around uh if you rotate it too

0:14:04.320,0:14:06.959
much that's fine you can just kind of

0:14:05.519,0:14:08.240
keep rotating around or you can hit

0:14:06.959,0:14:11.199
shift rotate

0:14:08.240,0:14:12.240
shift r to rotate a certain way and get

0:14:11.199,0:14:15.519
it to where it's

0:14:12.240,0:14:16.800
roughly located about here now what we

0:14:15.519,0:14:17.600
want to do is we want to connect the

0:14:16.800,0:14:19.920
wire

0:14:17.600,0:14:21.680
now uh what we learned before is that

0:14:19.920,0:14:22.959
you can click here

0:14:21.680,0:14:24.880
and then you can click there and it'll

0:14:22.959,0:14:26.720
connect a wire but if you look at their

0:14:24.880,0:14:27.519
picture it's got this cool like bend in

0:14:26.720,0:14:29.360
it right

0:14:27.519,0:14:31.600
um and so how did they get that cool

0:14:29.360,0:14:32.800
little bin uh well let me click undo and

0:14:31.600,0:14:35.440
let me just try it again

0:14:32.800,0:14:36.560
uh so you could click here and then

0:14:35.440,0:14:38.800
somewhere down here

0:14:36.560,0:14:40.560
and then over here and it puts a cool

0:14:38.800,0:14:42.560
bend in it for you right

0:14:40.560,0:14:43.920
but even if you don't do it perfect

0:14:42.560,0:14:45.279
that's fine you can always grab these

0:14:43.920,0:14:46.959
they're called handles

0:14:45.279,0:14:48.480
and you can move it around to your

0:14:46.959,0:14:50.720
heart's content

0:14:48.480,0:14:53.519
you could also change the color to be

0:14:50.720,0:14:53.519
red if you'd like

0:14:54.000,0:14:56.639
just to practice i'll show you another

0:14:55.360,0:14:58.000
way you could have done it let's say

0:14:56.639,0:15:00.480
that i had moved it from here to

0:14:58.000,0:15:01.680
here and i didn't add that bend well

0:15:00.480,0:15:03.199
what i can do is when the wire is

0:15:01.680,0:15:05.760
selected i can double click

0:15:03.199,0:15:08.079
and add a bend and then i can just move

0:15:05.760,0:15:09.360
it to wherever i want so you can always

0:15:08.079,0:15:10.959
edit wires

0:15:09.360,0:15:12.800
so don't care about if you get them

0:15:10.959,0:15:13.920
perfect the next time are you going to

0:15:12.800,0:15:15.199
perfect the first time

0:15:13.920,0:15:16.800
another thing that's nice to do with

0:15:15.199,0:15:18.160
wires is you can change their colors

0:15:16.800,0:15:19.680
using hotkeys

0:15:18.160,0:15:24.320
and i happen to know that red is the

0:15:19.680,0:15:25.920
number two so i just put my wire on here

0:15:24.320,0:15:28.399
i'm gonna choose to put it on with no

0:15:25.920,0:15:32.000
bend initially and then i'll add a bend

0:15:28.399,0:15:32.880
uh after the fact and it was red because

0:15:32.000,0:15:34.880
my last wire i

0:15:32.880,0:15:36.880
put on was red all right so let's go

0:15:34.880,0:15:38.079
ahead and start the simulation uh with

0:15:36.880,0:15:41.759
this

0:15:38.079,0:15:43.839
so um now um when i start the simulation

0:15:41.759,0:15:45.360
you can see it's going much slower

0:15:43.839,0:15:47.839
two oh i should have explained this

0:15:45.360,0:15:51.199
before rpms

0:15:47.839,0:15:54.320
this is revolutions per minute

0:15:51.199,0:15:56.720
uh it's a very common unit uh for motors

0:15:54.320,0:15:58.000
rpms revolutions per minute so right now

0:15:56.720,0:15:59.920
it's going very slow

0:15:58.000,0:16:01.360
because of this photocell but what i can

0:15:59.920,0:16:02.320
do in this photocell on the show in the

0:16:01.360,0:16:04.639
circuit here

0:16:02.320,0:16:06.399
is i can change how much light there is

0:16:04.639,0:16:08.720
in this photocell

0:16:06.399,0:16:09.600
and so if this photocell was in uh the

0:16:08.720,0:16:11.360
sun

0:16:09.600,0:16:13.360
uh the motor would go very very fast so

0:16:11.360,0:16:15.360
like if you took it outside in the sun

0:16:13.360,0:16:16.880
i would just start humming away right uh

0:16:15.360,0:16:19.040
but if you were in the dark

0:16:16.880,0:16:20.160
like inside the house or in a dark room

0:16:19.040,0:16:21.839
it'd be slower

0:16:20.160,0:16:24.000
and then if you turn off the lights i

0:16:21.839,0:16:26.000
would get super slow right

0:16:24.000,0:16:27.040
to the point where it's only going at

0:16:26.000,0:16:29.040
two rpms

0:16:27.040,0:16:31.040
and the reason for that is that this

0:16:29.040,0:16:33.839
component called a photo

0:16:31.040,0:16:35.199
resistor changes its resistance based on

0:16:33.839,0:16:37.759
how much light there is

0:16:35.199,0:16:38.480
uh whenever it's dark it's a really high

0:16:37.759,0:16:40.399
value

0:16:38.480,0:16:41.839
which makes the the circuit have very

0:16:40.399,0:16:44.160
little current flow through it

0:16:41.839,0:16:45.360
because it's got a lot of resistance uh

0:16:44.160,0:16:46.800
does that make sense

0:16:45.360,0:16:48.639
but again you can see the path of

0:16:46.800,0:16:50.240
current flow goes through here

0:16:48.639,0:16:51.600
and that's what makes the loop so the

0:16:50.240,0:16:53.279
only thing we wanted to learn about is

0:16:51.600,0:16:54.560
adding components so you just drag and

0:16:53.279,0:16:56.399
drop them from over here

0:16:54.560,0:16:56.960
and then some extra things about adding

0:16:56.399,0:16:58.320
wires

0:16:56.960,0:17:00.480
[Music]

0:16:58.320,0:17:01.920
great so i think that this one is done

0:17:00.480,0:17:03.600
uh so that was uh

0:17:01.920,0:17:05.679
it for the tutorials uh those are for

0:17:03.600,0:17:07.280
some pretty easy tutorials

0:17:05.679,0:17:08.799
uh once you've finished the tutorials

0:17:07.280,0:17:09.919
there's a button to like go back to the

0:17:08.799,0:17:11.520
project page

0:17:09.919,0:17:13.199
to be honest where it takes me back to

0:17:11.520,0:17:14.799
is not the page i really wanted

0:17:13.199,0:17:17.120
uh the page i really wanted i'm gonna

0:17:14.799,0:17:18.959
click on the tinkercad logo up here

0:17:17.120,0:17:21.280
and this will take me to my dashboard

0:17:18.959,0:17:22.559
right so my dashboard has of course the

0:17:21.280,0:17:24.959
3d designs

0:17:22.559,0:17:26.480
which we made yesterday and then it's

0:17:24.959,0:17:28.960
also got the circuits

0:17:26.480,0:17:31.280
that we're building today now mine still

0:17:28.960,0:17:32.640
has this tutorial here for try circuits

0:17:31.280,0:17:34.640
i do not want to click it again i've

0:17:32.640,0:17:36.000
already done it once instead what i want

0:17:34.640,0:17:39.840
to do is i want to say create

0:17:36.000,0:17:41.360
new circuits so this is the way

0:17:39.840,0:17:42.799
projects normally work when you click on

0:17:41.360,0:17:44.559
create new circuit there's no like

0:17:42.799,0:17:47.840
instructions over here

0:17:44.559,0:17:49.200
there's just like a blank canvas right

0:17:47.840,0:17:51.039
it does tell you that there's a cool

0:17:49.200,0:17:53.679
thing called starters

0:17:51.039,0:17:54.880
so we'll maybe do that sometime but we

0:17:53.679,0:17:56.080
don't really want that

0:17:54.880,0:17:57.919
for right now we're just going to click

0:17:56.080,0:17:59.520
on show me the basic components and

0:17:57.919,0:18:01.280
we'll do some things together

0:17:59.520,0:18:02.720
now one thing that's similar to 3d

0:18:01.280,0:18:03.919
modeling is when you create a new

0:18:02.720,0:18:07.039
project

0:18:03.919,0:18:08.559
it will create a crazy name for you up

0:18:07.039,0:18:10.080
in the upper left

0:18:08.559,0:18:13.679
i'm going to change this one to be

0:18:10.080,0:18:14.799
called my led

0:18:13.679,0:18:17.520
and what we're going to do is we're just

0:18:14.799,0:18:19.919
going to practice adding some components

0:18:17.520,0:18:22.000
and wiring them up so here's some

0:18:19.919,0:18:23.760
components we're going to add

0:18:22.000,0:18:25.520
we're going to add an led so go ahead

0:18:23.760,0:18:28.080
and drag an led and drop it onto your

0:18:25.520,0:18:31.679
canvas somewhere

0:18:28.080,0:18:34.559
and we're gonna add a resistor

0:18:31.679,0:18:36.320
um and then we're gonna add a battery so

0:18:34.559,0:18:37.200
those are the three things that we saw

0:18:36.320,0:18:40.480
before

0:18:37.200,0:18:42.320
uh that we use to uh to drive an led

0:18:40.480,0:18:44.240
before they used the coin battery this

0:18:42.320,0:18:45.280
time i used a double a battery

0:18:44.240,0:18:46.880
now what we're going to do is we're

0:18:45.280,0:18:48.080
going to before we wire this up we're

0:18:46.880,0:18:50.080
going to change

0:18:48.080,0:18:52.720
um some of the details of these

0:18:50.080,0:18:53.919
components the led can be any color you

0:18:52.720,0:18:55.760
want

0:18:53.919,0:18:57.280
so you can change the led color if you'd

0:18:55.760,0:18:58.559
like so i just

0:18:57.280,0:19:00.320
click on it and then i can change the

0:18:58.559,0:19:04.080
color of the led

0:19:00.320,0:19:06.880
uh the resistor should be a certain size

0:19:04.080,0:19:07.919
this is kind of an interesting game but

0:19:06.880,0:19:09.919
it can be

0:19:07.919,0:19:11.039
some number of kilo ohms that's like

0:19:09.919,0:19:14.400
thousands of ohms

0:19:11.039,0:19:15.360
right now it's one kilo ohm uh so it's a

0:19:14.400,0:19:19.039
thousand ohms

0:19:15.360,0:19:21.679
i'm going to switch it to 330 ohms right

0:19:19.039,0:19:25.520
so first off right now it's 1k ohm but

0:19:21.679,0:19:27.039
if i were to switch it to ohms here

0:19:25.520,0:19:28.960
what i did right there was identical

0:19:27.039,0:19:32.640
right so i could say one

0:19:28.960,0:19:34.000
kilo ohm or 1000 ohms and they're the

0:19:32.640,0:19:35.679
same number

0:19:34.000,0:19:37.320
i did this though because i actually

0:19:35.679,0:19:40.160
want to change it to

0:19:37.320,0:19:43.280
330 ohms so

0:19:40.160,0:19:45.840
330 ohms is the correct size

0:19:43.280,0:19:48.080
for a resistor so that the led is good

0:19:45.840,0:19:50.400
and bright but not too bright

0:19:48.080,0:19:52.559
and we won't go into the math but 330 is

0:19:50.400,0:19:54.880
a good value

0:19:52.559,0:19:55.679
next up is the battery so the battery

0:19:54.880,0:19:57.840
actually

0:19:55.679,0:19:59.200
has some features with them changed to

0:19:57.840,0:20:02.400
the first is the count

0:19:59.200,0:20:04.000
i actually want four batteries um and

0:20:02.400,0:20:05.520
then do you want a built-in switch yes

0:20:04.000,0:20:07.840
or no i'm going to say

0:20:05.520,0:20:09.200
yes so they actually sell these things

0:20:07.840,0:20:10.400
where it's like a little four pack of

0:20:09.200,0:20:12.159
double a batteries

0:20:10.400,0:20:13.600
uh and then they've got a little like on

0:20:12.159,0:20:16.080
off switch on the top here

0:20:13.600,0:20:18.480
which is kind of handy in this case four

0:20:16.080,0:20:21.919
double a batteries by the way each one

0:20:18.480,0:20:24.960
is 1.5 volts uh so four of them together

0:20:21.919,0:20:28.080
would be what your wrath feels like

0:20:24.960,0:20:30.000
1.4 would be 6 volts

0:20:28.080,0:20:31.840
6 volts that's right yep so 6 volts

0:20:30.000,0:20:35.039
there all right so let's go ahead

0:20:31.840,0:20:36.480
and hook up this circuit now

0:20:35.039,0:20:38.159
so to hook up this circuit what i want

0:20:36.480,0:20:39.360
to do is i want to take the positive

0:20:38.159,0:20:42.559
voltage

0:20:39.360,0:20:44.080
uh and connect it to the anode of the

0:20:42.559,0:20:46.240
led

0:20:44.080,0:20:48.880
uh and then i like to make my wire be

0:20:46.240,0:20:50.320
the same color as my led just for fun

0:20:48.880,0:20:52.159
and in this case it's already done

0:20:50.320,0:20:53.679
because it's green

0:20:52.159,0:20:55.760
um and then what i want to do is i want

0:20:53.679,0:20:57.360
to take the cathode and connect it to

0:20:55.760,0:20:58.559
the resistor

0:20:57.360,0:21:00.400
and then take the other end of the

0:20:58.559,0:21:02.559
resistor and connect it to

0:21:00.400,0:21:03.600
the negative terminal and now what i'm

0:21:02.559,0:21:05.760
going to choose to do is i'm going to

0:21:03.600,0:21:07.440
make that side be black

0:21:05.760,0:21:08.799
because this is the the connection to

0:21:07.440,0:21:10.159
ground technically this is the

0:21:08.799,0:21:12.159
connection to ground

0:21:10.159,0:21:13.679
this is the connection to the led and

0:21:12.159,0:21:15.600
this is just some wire in the middle

0:21:13.679,0:21:18.720
that can be any color you want right

0:21:15.600,0:21:21.360
so this right here is a good

0:21:18.720,0:21:22.480
led circuit if you click on start

0:21:21.360,0:21:24.000
simulation

0:21:22.480,0:21:25.919
when you click on start simulation it

0:21:24.000,0:21:27.360
turned your battery pack on for you

0:21:25.919,0:21:29.440
which is very nice of them

0:21:27.360,0:21:31.200
but you can turn it on and off with this

0:21:29.440,0:21:35.679
button here so this is a

0:21:31.200,0:21:37.200
properly made led circuit

0:21:35.679,0:21:39.840
now what i want you to do just to kind

0:21:37.200,0:21:42.640
of practice uh see if you can

0:21:39.840,0:21:44.080
practice those skills that we just did

0:21:42.640,0:21:46.640
and make a bad led

0:21:44.080,0:21:48.159
circuit right next to it so bring over

0:21:46.640,0:21:49.520
um another led

0:21:48.159,0:21:51.360
i know you could duplicate that one but

0:21:49.520,0:21:54.159
bring over another one bring over

0:21:51.360,0:21:54.880
another battery pack change the color of

0:21:54.159,0:21:58.000
the led

0:21:54.880,0:21:59.520
as you see fit set up the battery pack

0:21:58.000,0:22:02.559
to have the right features to look just

0:21:59.520,0:22:05.039
like that one and this time just for fun

0:22:02.559,0:22:06.960
connect it with no resistor so just make

0:22:05.039,0:22:08.640
the wire go from the cathode

0:22:06.960,0:22:11.360
straight to the negative terminal of the

0:22:08.640,0:22:12.880
battery and once you build that

0:22:11.360,0:22:14.559
we'll see what happens when you run your

0:22:12.880,0:22:15.840
simulation so take a minute and try to

0:22:14.559,0:22:16.960
make that happen

0:22:15.840,0:22:18.640
all right so i'll go ahead and do it

0:22:16.960,0:22:20.159
really quick but hopefully you were

0:22:18.640,0:22:23.760
successful in that so i added

0:22:20.159,0:22:25.440
an led and then i added just one battery

0:22:23.760,0:22:26.880
but then i switch it to four and i

0:22:25.440,0:22:27.919
switch it to have a switch that's how i

0:22:26.880,0:22:29.520
did that

0:22:27.919,0:22:31.760
uh if you try to run the uh the

0:22:29.520,0:22:33.600
simulation right now uh your led doesn't

0:22:31.760,0:22:34.000
do much because i forgot the wires right

0:22:33.600,0:22:36.400
so

0:22:34.000,0:22:37.520
make sure you add wires uh and the wires

0:22:36.400,0:22:39.600
that i'm gonna add this time i'm gonna

0:22:37.520,0:22:42.640
do it wrong i'm gonna add a red one

0:22:39.600,0:22:44.000
which i happen to know is color two and

0:22:42.640,0:22:46.559
a black one

0:22:44.000,0:22:48.159
which i happen to know is color one i

0:22:46.559,0:22:49.120
just use the hot keys to save myself

0:22:48.159,0:22:51.600
time right

0:22:49.120,0:22:53.200
and so now if you start your simulation

0:22:51.600,0:22:55.919
uh this is a

0:22:53.200,0:22:57.200
bad bad thing right so it says the

0:22:55.919,0:23:00.320
current to the led

0:22:57.200,0:23:04.080
is 487 milliamps while the

0:23:00.320,0:23:07.600
absolute maximum is 20 milliamps right

0:23:04.080,0:23:09.520
and so we didn't size our resistor right

0:23:07.600,0:23:11.280
and it warns you that this is bad for

0:23:09.520,0:23:13.520
leds right

0:23:11.280,0:23:14.640
cool so that's all i wanted to do with

0:23:13.520,0:23:15.440
this one i just wanted to get you a

0:23:14.640,0:23:17.280
little practice

0:23:15.440,0:23:19.200
uh adding some things and adding some

0:23:17.280,0:23:20.159
wires uh and now we're going to do

0:23:19.200,0:23:23.840
something

0:23:20.159,0:23:24.480
a lot more complex so my led uh is now

0:23:23.840,0:23:26.159
done

0:23:24.480,0:23:27.360
uh if you wanted to you could share it

0:23:26.159,0:23:27.919
there's different things you could do to

0:23:27.360,0:23:30.559
share it

0:23:27.919,0:23:32.320
i'm not that worried about it just yet

0:23:30.559,0:23:33.440
so go ahead and go back to your

0:23:32.320,0:23:34.880
dashboard

0:23:33.440,0:23:36.720
the easiest way to get there is to click

0:23:34.880,0:23:38.640
on the little tinker logo

0:23:36.720,0:23:40.320
and everybody always asks how do i save

0:23:38.640,0:23:42.400
uh that led thing it's like well it gets

0:23:40.320,0:23:43.919
saved automatically

0:23:42.400,0:23:45.840
all right so go ahead and click on new

0:23:43.919,0:23:46.720
circuit and we're going to start the

0:23:45.840,0:23:49.360
like actual

0:23:46.720,0:23:50.000
factual thing we're doing today and that

0:23:49.360,0:23:52.480
is to build

0:23:50.000,0:23:53.360
the the stop light uh where if i press

0:23:52.480,0:23:55.279
this button

0:23:53.360,0:23:58.880
uh it'll go through green and then

0:23:55.279,0:24:02.480
yellow red so that's our goal today

0:23:58.880,0:24:05.039
so our last circuit was just like

0:24:02.480,0:24:06.400
batteries and leds and that was all good

0:24:05.039,0:24:09.440
but really

0:24:06.400,0:24:09.840
what tinkercad simulator is for is it's

0:24:09.440,0:24:12.799
for

0:24:09.840,0:24:14.080
simulating arduino circuits so the first

0:24:12.799,0:24:17.279
thing i want you to do is i want you to

0:24:14.080,0:24:19.520
drag an arduino uno r3

0:24:17.279,0:24:21.200
out from the side and put it right onto

0:24:19.520,0:24:22.720
your canvas

0:24:21.200,0:24:25.120
the next thing that i like to do is i

0:24:22.720,0:24:26.159
like to rotate it so i like to look at

0:24:25.120,0:24:28.159
it this way

0:24:26.159,0:24:30.400
it makes the text way easier for my eyes

0:24:28.159,0:24:32.000
to read

0:24:30.400,0:24:33.440
oh actually you could change the name of

0:24:32.000,0:24:36.400
it as well

0:24:33.440,0:24:38.080
i'm gonna call it my stoplights you

0:24:36.400,0:24:39.120
don't have to start every program uh

0:24:38.080,0:24:41.520
with the word my

0:24:39.120,0:24:42.720
but you certainly can if you'd like um

0:24:41.520,0:24:46.000
in addition to

0:24:42.720,0:24:48.640
uh the arduino uno most

0:24:46.000,0:24:50.320
people use these breadboards so go ahead

0:24:48.640,0:24:54.240
and drag a breadboard

0:24:50.320,0:24:57.039
uh from the component area over here

0:24:54.240,0:24:58.960
to your workspace and then hit r a

0:24:57.039,0:25:00.880
couple times

0:24:58.960,0:25:02.880
i usually this is how people kind of set

0:25:00.880,0:25:05.440
up their uh their board so they put an

0:25:02.880,0:25:07.120
arduino uno right next to the breadboard

0:25:05.440,0:25:08.480
uh no shock that's what the good people

0:25:07.120,0:25:10.159
at sparkfun did as well right and they

0:25:08.480,0:25:11.679
even put a like a little uh backing

0:25:10.159,0:25:13.919
piece right so pretty common

0:25:11.679,0:25:15.440
uh way to set up things and the reason

0:25:13.919,0:25:17.840
breadboards are so popular

0:25:15.440,0:25:18.960
is because it's really hard even with

0:25:17.840,0:25:20.960
the last circle we did

0:25:18.960,0:25:22.799
to hold a bunch of wires i can hold

0:25:20.960,0:25:24.640
about two and then i run out of hands

0:25:22.799,0:25:26.559
um and so people plug them into these

0:25:24.640,0:25:28.640
breadboards and that's a great way to

0:25:26.559,0:25:30.240
make connections so now what we're going

0:25:28.640,0:25:31.840
to do is we're going to make another led

0:25:30.240,0:25:34.559
circuit

0:25:31.840,0:25:36.880
so go ahead and take an led i'm going to

0:25:34.559,0:25:40.240
put it somewhere near the top

0:25:36.880,0:25:41.520
and i'm going to rotate it until it's

0:25:40.240,0:25:43.840
sideways

0:25:41.520,0:25:45.120
and i'm going to pop it right into the

0:25:43.840,0:25:47.120
breadboard

0:25:45.120,0:25:49.120
and now this is analogous to physically

0:25:47.120,0:25:51.279
like taking an led and putting it in the

0:25:49.120,0:25:53.520
breadboard so i really like that

0:25:51.279,0:25:55.039
and the way this works is uh whenever i

0:25:53.520,0:25:57.520
plug it into the breadboard

0:25:55.039,0:25:58.799
i can then plug a wire in anywhere to

0:25:57.520,0:26:01.200
this row

0:25:58.799,0:26:01.840
and it's like i'm holding it to that leg

0:26:01.200,0:26:03.919
of the

0:26:01.840,0:26:05.520
of the led so what i want to do is i

0:26:03.919,0:26:08.320
want to take this

0:26:05.520,0:26:10.720
leg right here and this is the side i

0:26:08.320,0:26:13.440
normally put so this is my anode side

0:26:10.720,0:26:14.559
this is the one i normally put to a

0:26:13.440,0:26:17.600
battery

0:26:14.559,0:26:18.799
but i'm going to connect it over to i

0:26:17.600,0:26:21.760
think i'll use pin

0:26:18.799,0:26:22.960
what the heck i'll use pen four really

0:26:21.760,0:26:24.799
you could use about

0:26:22.960,0:26:26.880
any pen you wanted on this side 0

0:26:24.799,0:26:28.080
through 13. the ones over here are used

0:26:26.880,0:26:29.279
for different things they're used for

0:26:28.080,0:26:31.039
analog things

0:26:29.279,0:26:32.799
but i just want to connect this to pin

0:26:31.039,0:26:36.400
4.

0:26:32.799,0:26:38.799
if you would like this is a red led

0:26:36.400,0:26:40.799
so you could choose to make the wire red

0:26:38.799,0:26:43.679
if you want it's completely optional

0:26:40.799,0:26:44.799
uh also depending on your level of

0:26:43.679,0:26:47.039
ocdness

0:26:44.799,0:26:47.919
in your life you can choose to double

0:26:47.039,0:26:51.039
click on it

0:26:47.919,0:26:51.679
and add bin points and you can make it

0:26:51.039,0:26:54.159
um

0:26:51.679,0:26:54.799
you know as pretty as you would like um

0:26:54.159,0:26:56.159
prettiness

0:26:54.799,0:26:58.000
doesn't matter if your wires are a

0:26:56.159,0:27:00.000
jumble it still works but you could

0:26:58.000,0:27:02.400
choose to make it pretty if you'd like

0:27:00.000,0:27:03.679
next we need to add a resistor and now

0:27:02.400,0:27:04.880
what i'm going to do with the resistor

0:27:03.679,0:27:07.039
is this

0:27:04.880,0:27:08.720
i'm going to put it on my breadboard and

0:27:07.039,0:27:10.799
so by putting it here

0:27:08.720,0:27:12.799
so i very specifically put it in this

0:27:10.799,0:27:15.840
exact spot by putting it here

0:27:12.799,0:27:16.240
that connects the top of the resistor to

0:27:15.840,0:27:20.799
the

0:27:16.240,0:27:23.840
cathode of the led and then the bottom

0:27:20.799,0:27:26.000
i'm going to connect to this ground rail

0:27:23.840,0:27:30.000
that's right here

0:27:26.000,0:27:32.399
i like to make my ground rails black

0:27:30.000,0:27:33.600
so i'll make it black also again being

0:27:32.399,0:27:35.760
very ocd

0:27:33.600,0:27:37.440
i'm going to add little bins so that it

0:27:35.760,0:27:38.559
kind of looks like it's connected to the

0:27:37.440,0:27:40.320
black one

0:27:38.559,0:27:44.080
and doesn't like shoot over the top of a

0:27:40.320,0:27:46.000
red one again that doesn't really matter

0:27:44.080,0:27:48.559
so here's what i'm doing now i've got

0:27:46.000,0:27:50.880
power that's going to come from pin four

0:27:48.559,0:27:52.320
um an arduino has this ability to kind

0:27:50.880,0:27:53.919
of like be like a battery to where it

0:27:52.320,0:27:56.320
provides power or not

0:27:53.919,0:27:58.399
um and it's gonna go into my anode it's

0:27:56.320,0:27:59.840
gonna flow through my led

0:27:58.399,0:28:01.520
it's gonna flow through my resistor

0:27:59.840,0:28:03.520
which is currently the wrong size

0:28:01.520,0:28:05.039
and it's going to flow into this ground

0:28:03.520,0:28:06.799
rail uh now there's two things we need

0:28:05.039,0:28:08.159
to fix one thing we need to fix is this

0:28:06.799,0:28:10.399
ground rail

0:28:08.159,0:28:12.240
isn't magic it's not connected to ground

0:28:10.399,0:28:13.919
magically you have to actually connect

0:28:12.240,0:28:15.520
it to ground somewhere

0:28:13.919,0:28:17.679
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

0:28:15.520,0:28:20.880
connect it from right here

0:28:17.679,0:28:22.159
to the gnd that's right over here gnd is

0:28:20.880,0:28:24.480
short for ground

0:28:22.159,0:28:25.919
so my arduino board is going to get

0:28:24.480,0:28:27.279
power from the computer

0:28:25.919,0:28:30.159
and it's going to be basically my

0:28:27.279,0:28:31.679
battery that can be turned on and off

0:28:30.159,0:28:33.279
this black wire here by the way it's

0:28:31.679,0:28:35.520
connected through this rail

0:28:33.279,0:28:36.960
to this wire so it goes to ground there

0:28:35.520,0:28:38.799
the other thing i want to fix is i want

0:28:36.960,0:28:39.840
a different size resistor instead of one

0:28:38.799,0:28:42.320
kiloohm

0:28:39.840,0:28:43.279
i'm going to switch it to regular old

0:28:42.320,0:28:46.480
ohms

0:28:43.279,0:28:49.360
and use 330.

0:28:46.480,0:28:51.679
cool so now i have an led circuit

0:28:49.360,0:28:53.760
connected to pin 4.

0:28:51.679,0:28:55.840
if i start my simulation though you'll

0:28:53.760,0:28:56.960
notice that my light does not go on and

0:28:55.840,0:28:58.640
off

0:28:56.960,0:29:00.480
interestingly there is a light that is

0:28:58.640,0:29:00.880
going on and off though uh there's a

0:29:00.480,0:29:02.960
little

0:29:00.880,0:29:04.559
light right here that's going on and off

0:29:02.960,0:29:05.600
that's kind of cool how's that why is

0:29:04.559,0:29:07.360
that doing that

0:29:05.600,0:29:08.799
um let's go look at the code to figure

0:29:07.360,0:29:12.159
out why that's doing that

0:29:08.799,0:29:15.600
so click on code so whenever

0:29:12.159,0:29:18.480
you um brought over your arduino

0:29:15.600,0:29:20.880
it actually had some code for you and

0:29:18.480,0:29:21.520
the code that it has is using the blocks

0:29:20.880,0:29:23.840
mode

0:29:21.520,0:29:24.640
again you can use blocks blocks plus

0:29:23.840,0:29:27.200
text

0:29:24.640,0:29:28.159
or text today i'm going to primarily use

0:29:27.200,0:29:31.360
blocks plus

0:29:28.159,0:29:32.880
text the only downside of blocks plus

0:29:31.360,0:29:34.000
text is it does take up like most of

0:29:32.880,0:29:36.159
your screen

0:29:34.000,0:29:38.480
but here's what blocks plus text does

0:29:36.159,0:29:40.080
well it lets you use blocks

0:29:38.480,0:29:42.240
so this is your tool palette and then

0:29:40.080,0:29:43.840
this is your code but it lets you see

0:29:42.240,0:29:46.480
the text that gets typed

0:29:43.840,0:29:47.360
and this would be a good transition for

0:29:46.480,0:29:48.960
tomorrow

0:29:47.360,0:29:50.880
when we just go straight into the text

0:29:48.960,0:29:51.760
right but the reason that this light is

0:29:50.880,0:29:53.679
flashing

0:29:51.760,0:29:55.520
is because there's this code that says

0:29:53.679,0:29:58.399
set the built-in led

0:29:55.520,0:29:59.360
that's this little guy right here to

0:29:58.399,0:30:02.000
high

0:29:59.360,0:30:03.440
wait for a second and then set it to low

0:30:02.000,0:30:05.039
and wait for a second

0:30:03.440,0:30:07.760
you can also see that in the text over

0:30:05.039,0:30:11.279
here there was a setup function

0:30:07.760,0:30:13.440
somebody made pin 13 an output so pin

0:30:11.279,0:30:15.919
13 that's this pin right here it

0:30:13.440,0:30:18.000
actually is controlling this led

0:30:15.919,0:30:19.440
and it's going high wait for a second

0:30:18.000,0:30:20.880
low wait for a second

0:30:19.440,0:30:22.720
and if you wanted to you could modify it

0:30:20.880,0:30:24.159
you can make it be low for for three

0:30:22.720,0:30:26.720
seconds and you can see how

0:30:24.159,0:30:27.600
change in the blocks uh changes the code

0:30:26.720,0:30:29.679
instantly

0:30:27.600,0:30:30.880
so that's why it's going high and then

0:30:29.679,0:30:32.320
right now it's going low for three

0:30:30.880,0:30:35.600
seconds because i just changed that

0:30:32.320,0:30:36.799
and then hi and then back off

0:30:35.600,0:30:37.919
i don't want to turn that light on

0:30:36.799,0:30:39.200
enough though i want to turn this light

0:30:37.919,0:30:40.640
over here on and off

0:30:39.200,0:30:43.520
so what i'm going to do is i'll tell you

0:30:40.640,0:30:45.440
what i'm just going to trash their code

0:30:43.520,0:30:48.960
so you can see that this is uh now empty

0:30:45.440,0:30:50.559
over here i want to bring in my own code

0:30:48.960,0:30:52.399
and what i want to do is i want to set

0:30:50.559,0:30:55.840
pin 4

0:30:52.399,0:30:58.720
to high and then i want to wait for a

0:30:55.840,0:31:01.360
second a wait is over and controlled

0:30:58.720,0:31:02.880
so i'm going to wait for a second and

0:31:01.360,0:31:06.799
then back into outputs

0:31:02.880,0:31:06.799
and then i'm going to set pin 4

0:31:06.880,0:31:13.600
to low so you can see that

0:31:10.960,0:31:14.960
blocks are nice because there's less

0:31:13.600,0:31:16.159
errors that you can make as you're

0:31:14.960,0:31:18.640
getting started

0:31:16.159,0:31:19.919
but it is also nice to see the code uh

0:31:18.640,0:31:22.159
because that'll like

0:31:19.919,0:31:23.600
teach you how to how to use uh arduinos

0:31:22.159,0:31:25.600
in the wild right

0:31:23.600,0:31:27.039
and then after i go low i'm gonna set

0:31:25.600,0:31:31.120
this to uh

0:31:27.039,0:31:34.320
um wait for one second as well

0:31:31.120,0:31:36.799
great uh so now i've got my code here um

0:31:34.320,0:31:37.600
so set pin four high wait for a second

0:31:36.799,0:31:40.080
set pin for

0:31:37.600,0:31:40.799
low wait for a second uh by the way some

0:31:40.080,0:31:41.919
people ask

0:31:40.799,0:31:43.679
uh you know what's the difference

0:31:41.919,0:31:44.960
between this one where it says set pin

0:31:43.679,0:31:48.159
blank too high

0:31:44.960,0:31:50.240
versus this one set pin this to zero

0:31:48.159,0:31:51.279
this one right here is for an analog

0:31:50.240,0:31:52.960
right

0:31:51.279,0:31:54.799
and you kind of see the the code that's

0:31:52.960,0:31:56.399
up over there and that's not what we

0:31:54.799,0:31:58.799
want right now we want to set it

0:31:56.399,0:32:00.080
all the way higher all the way low so if

0:31:58.799,0:32:01.679
you start your simulation now i know

0:32:00.080,0:32:04.159
it's crammed way over the corner

0:32:01.679,0:32:04.880
uh but you should have this light go on

0:32:04.159,0:32:08.320
and off

0:32:04.880,0:32:11.600
on off on off

0:32:08.320,0:32:14.720
cool not too bad uh let's

0:32:11.600,0:32:16.640
build some more uh while i'm building

0:32:14.720,0:32:18.080
more i want my code to kind of like hide

0:32:16.640,0:32:19.600
to give me more space so i'm just gonna

0:32:18.080,0:32:21.200
press that button for code

0:32:19.600,0:32:23.519
it'll just kind of hide over there it's

0:32:21.200,0:32:25.039
not gone and what i want you to do is i

0:32:23.519,0:32:28.000
want you to see if you can build

0:32:25.039,0:32:30.159
two more led circuits uh maybe put one

0:32:28.000,0:32:31.760
in about the middle put one kind of like

0:32:30.159,0:32:32.960
near the bottom but not all the way at

0:32:31.760,0:32:34.559
the bottom because i need to leave room

0:32:32.960,0:32:36.320
for a button

0:32:34.559,0:32:38.880
uh but see if you can make the uh the

0:32:36.320,0:32:41.279
middle one be a yellow light

0:32:38.880,0:32:42.320
and then make the bottom one be a green

0:32:41.279,0:32:44.000
light

0:32:42.320,0:32:46.080
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

0:32:44.000,0:32:47.360
not show you how i do it

0:32:46.080,0:32:50.080
and i'm going to let you do it on your

0:32:47.360,0:32:51.919
own you can optionally make the wires

0:32:50.080,0:32:54.000
yellow and greens appropriate but again

0:32:51.919,0:32:56.000
remember that doesn't actually matter

0:32:54.000,0:32:58.799
so go and pause the video go make it

0:32:56.000,0:32:58.799
happen on your own

0:33:00.080,0:33:03.760
all right so i've got my beautiful

0:33:01.600,0:33:05.600
circuit here um and if i run the

0:33:03.760,0:33:07.200
simulation obviously it just does the

0:33:05.600,0:33:09.360
red light still

0:33:07.200,0:33:10.799
but i'm hoping that i've wired the rest

0:33:09.360,0:33:12.320
of these correctly

0:33:10.799,0:33:14.320
and now i can write code for them as

0:33:12.320,0:33:16.720
well so let's go ahead and

0:33:14.320,0:33:18.399
write some code and test to see whether

0:33:16.720,0:33:20.960
we've done anything useful

0:33:18.399,0:33:22.640
uh or all you know at all so what i want

0:33:20.960,0:33:24.080
to do is i'm going to start off by just

0:33:22.640,0:33:26.640
making them all

0:33:24.080,0:33:28.880
go high oops that was the wrong command

0:33:26.640,0:33:30.559
i want to make them all go high together

0:33:28.880,0:33:31.919
and then i'll go low together and just

0:33:30.559,0:33:35.120
see if that works

0:33:31.919,0:33:38.559
so i'm going to grab this set pin

0:33:35.120,0:33:39.279
high so my goal is to make them all go

0:33:38.559,0:33:41.840
high

0:33:39.279,0:33:43.519
uh and then make them all go low so

0:33:41.840,0:33:45.039
here's what i'm gonna do

0:33:43.519,0:33:46.480
i'm gonna get some commands ready now

0:33:45.039,0:33:47.279
i'm gonna set the arguments on them so

0:33:46.480,0:33:50.720
i'm gonna make

0:33:47.279,0:33:54.320
four three and two

0:33:50.720,0:33:58.559
so four three two be high high high

0:33:54.320,0:33:58.559
and then i'm gonna make four three two

0:34:00.080,0:34:03.519
be low low low

0:34:04.640,0:34:11.200
high high high low low low

0:34:08.320,0:34:13.040
and now if i start my simulation i can

0:34:11.200,0:34:16.480
test to see whether my

0:34:13.040,0:34:17.520
wires are correct um and if my wires are

0:34:16.480,0:34:20.960
correct

0:34:17.520,0:34:22.480
i should see uh flashing uh red yellow

0:34:20.960,0:34:24.639
green kind of all together

0:34:22.480,0:34:26.159
i'm curious to see how my camper is

0:34:24.639,0:34:29.440
doing over here

0:34:26.159,0:34:30.639
how's it going sis let's see what hers

0:34:29.440,0:34:34.000
looks like

0:34:30.639,0:34:35.520
all her wires are in jumble so not

0:34:34.000,0:34:38.079
enough no they're not

0:34:35.520,0:34:39.200
thought of hey it's working great though

0:34:38.079,0:34:43.919
red yellow green

0:34:39.200,0:34:43.919
uh which is perfect way to go sis

0:34:44.000,0:34:48.639
all right so let's write some more code

0:34:45.760,0:34:50.879
uh so let's make it kind of look like

0:34:48.639,0:34:53.440
there's a pattern right so let's make it

0:34:50.879,0:34:56.320
look like it goes green yellow red

0:34:53.440,0:34:57.920
green yellow red uh so you can pause the

0:34:56.320,0:34:58.480
video and see if you can do that on your

0:34:57.920,0:34:59.680
own

0:34:58.480,0:35:02.480
uh but i'll go ahead and show you this

0:34:59.680,0:35:03.520
one with you so um right now if we

0:35:02.480,0:35:06.560
wanted green

0:35:03.520,0:35:09.680
well green would be turning on just

0:35:06.560,0:35:11.280
pin two so pin

0:35:09.680,0:35:14.400
two it's hard to see everything at once

0:35:11.280,0:35:16.720
right pin two is my green one

0:35:14.400,0:35:17.760
so if i turn on just pin two so low low

0:35:16.720,0:35:21.280
high

0:35:17.760,0:35:24.400
and then yellow would be a low

0:35:21.280,0:35:27.200
high low uh and then

0:35:24.400,0:35:28.800
uh the last one um so i guess i kind of

0:35:27.200,0:35:30.640
need another set here sorry

0:35:28.800,0:35:31.920
i was sneaky i did a duplicate of the

0:35:30.640,0:35:34.960
bottom four lines

0:35:31.920,0:35:39.359
um and then the last one is high

0:35:34.960,0:35:41.200
low low so high low

0:35:39.359,0:35:42.560
so what this should do is this should go

0:35:41.200,0:35:43.200
through a little simulation where it's

0:35:42.560,0:35:46.960
green

0:35:43.200,0:35:50.079
yellow red green yellow

0:35:46.960,0:35:51.520
red cool so the last thing i want to do

0:35:50.079,0:35:54.560
so i'm almost there

0:35:51.520,0:35:56.160
is i want it to only do like green

0:35:54.560,0:35:57.680
yellow red

0:35:56.160,0:35:59.280
after i push the button so i want to

0:35:57.680,0:36:03.280
push the button

0:35:59.280,0:36:04.960
and have it go green yellow and then red

0:36:03.280,0:36:08.160
and then just stay at red until i push

0:36:04.960,0:36:10.720
the button again so we're doing great

0:36:08.160,0:36:11.680
so leds are the most common things that

0:36:10.720,0:36:13.200
you'll wire up

0:36:11.680,0:36:15.200
the next most common thing that you'll

0:36:13.200,0:36:16.240
wire up are push buttons

0:36:15.200,0:36:19.599
so let's go ahead and stop the

0:36:16.240,0:36:22.240
simulation hide the code

0:36:19.599,0:36:24.240
let's go ahead and add a push button so

0:36:22.240,0:36:25.920
here's a push button

0:36:24.240,0:36:27.599
push buttons are sneaky uh they've

0:36:25.920,0:36:30.240
actually got four legs

0:36:27.599,0:36:31.359
it would appear uh but actually there's

0:36:30.240,0:36:33.920
there's only two right

0:36:31.359,0:36:35.440
so these two top and bottom that i see

0:36:33.920,0:36:36.800
here they're actually connected by a

0:36:35.440,0:36:37.920
piece of metal inside

0:36:36.800,0:36:39.520
and what you have to do is you have to

0:36:37.920,0:36:40.480
put them on your breadboard in a certain

0:36:39.520,0:36:42.000
way

0:36:40.480,0:36:43.599
and it's not this way because it won't

0:36:42.000,0:36:46.640
even spread the middle you've got to

0:36:43.599,0:36:48.160
rotate it so i'm going to hit rr

0:36:46.640,0:36:50.320
so my push button i brought it over and

0:36:48.160,0:36:53.680
i hit rr and now

0:36:50.320,0:36:55.520
it should fit right into my breadboard

0:36:53.680,0:36:57.280
uh and what's actually happening here is

0:36:55.520,0:36:59.520
there's a top to the switch

0:36:57.280,0:37:01.200
uh so this top is actually all connected

0:36:59.520,0:37:01.839
together by a piece of metal that's

0:37:01.200,0:37:03.839
inside

0:37:01.839,0:37:05.440
and then there's a bottom to the switch

0:37:03.839,0:37:07.119
which is all together

0:37:05.440,0:37:09.680
and the way this works is there's

0:37:07.119,0:37:11.520
literally a piece of metal in the button

0:37:09.680,0:37:13.119
when you press that piece of metal down

0:37:11.520,0:37:14.079
it connects the metal on the top and the

0:37:13.119,0:37:16.640
metal on the bottom

0:37:14.079,0:37:18.480
and it lets it be connected like a wire

0:37:16.640,0:37:20.160
and when you're not touching the button

0:37:18.480,0:37:21.680
there's no metal connection so it's just

0:37:20.160,0:37:23.680
like two wires that are either

0:37:21.680,0:37:26.400
touching when you press the button or

0:37:23.680,0:37:28.400
not touching and that stops current flow

0:37:26.400,0:37:29.839
or allows it so we're going to do is

0:37:28.400,0:37:30.720
we're going to connect the bottom to

0:37:29.839,0:37:33.440
ground

0:37:30.720,0:37:33.839
and then the top i'm going to connect to

0:37:33.440,0:37:37.440
pin

0:37:33.839,0:37:40.320
0 over here uh and i'm going to make it

0:37:37.440,0:37:41.599
blue it's kind of funny instead of using

0:37:40.320,0:37:43.119
that i like the hot keys but i can

0:37:41.599,0:37:44.800
remember which one blue was so i just

0:37:43.119,0:37:46.880
guessed a whole bunch right

0:37:44.800,0:37:49.119
all right so we've got a push button uh

0:37:46.880,0:37:52.880
that's now connected to

0:37:49.119,0:37:55.520
r0 sorry pin 0

0:37:52.880,0:37:57.200
and the way this works is internally the

0:37:55.520,0:37:59.680
arduino uno is going to pull it

0:37:57.200,0:38:01.359
to 5 volts if you don't press the button

0:37:59.680,0:38:03.359
but whenever you press the button

0:38:01.359,0:38:04.880
it's going to take this blue wire and

0:38:03.359,0:38:06.880
it's going to connect it to ground

0:38:04.880,0:38:08.960
right so it's kind of interesting that a

0:38:06.880,0:38:12.480
push button at least on arduino

0:38:08.960,0:38:15.599
is when you press it that makes it low

0:38:12.480,0:38:17.119
so a press is a low and then a not press

0:38:15.599,0:38:18.240
is a high that's backwards of how some

0:38:17.119,0:38:21.119
people think

0:38:18.240,0:38:21.599
all right so uh we made a circuit uh

0:38:21.119,0:38:24.079
which is

0:38:21.599,0:38:25.520
which is how arduinos work and then we

0:38:24.079,0:38:28.240
test it with code

0:38:25.520,0:38:29.680
so what we want to do is we want to um

0:38:28.240,0:38:32.560
check

0:38:29.680,0:38:33.040
if somebody presses that button a check

0:38:32.560,0:38:36.720
is a

0:38:33.040,0:38:39.760
if statement so go to control

0:38:36.720,0:38:39.760
find the if statement

0:38:40.400,0:38:43.119
and i'll tell you what i'll go ahead and

0:38:41.520,0:38:44.880
wrap the if statement around my whole

0:38:43.119,0:38:46.240
thing so if you if you move it into just

0:38:44.880,0:38:47.119
the right position it wraps it around

0:38:46.240,0:38:48.720
the whole thing

0:38:47.119,0:38:50.320
now i don't really want the whole thing

0:38:48.720,0:38:53.520
in here i just want the

0:38:50.320,0:38:55.839
the green and yellow part inside of here

0:38:53.520,0:38:58.960
and then this bottom part the red part i

0:38:55.839,0:39:01.359
can just take it off right

0:38:58.960,0:39:03.680
and in fact this this bottom weight i

0:39:01.359,0:39:05.760
don't actually need

0:39:03.680,0:39:07.280
so i did a couple changes quickly there

0:39:05.760,0:39:09.200
but i think you can see my code to kind

0:39:07.280,0:39:11.760
of understand what's going on here so

0:39:09.200,0:39:12.480
if you press this button then show me

0:39:11.760,0:39:14.079
green

0:39:12.480,0:39:15.760
for a second maybe you can make that

0:39:14.079,0:39:17.920
like three seconds

0:39:15.760,0:39:19.920
uh and then show me yellow for one

0:39:17.920,0:39:21.200
second and then go back to just showing

0:39:19.920,0:39:22.560
me red

0:39:21.200,0:39:24.640
and so the thing we're missing is we're

0:39:22.560,0:39:26.000
missing a condition here for our if

0:39:24.640,0:39:27.119
you can actually look at our code and

0:39:26.000,0:39:28.000
see it's like hey we're kind of missing

0:39:27.119,0:39:30.800
a condition right there

0:39:28.000,0:39:31.359
for if let's go um we want to see if

0:39:30.800,0:39:34.800
that

0:39:31.359,0:39:36.240
input is equal to zero so what i'm going

0:39:34.800,0:39:38.560
to do is i'm going to go into math

0:39:36.240,0:39:41.040
first you'll notice that this is kind of

0:39:38.560,0:39:41.760
a triangular like hexagonal looking

0:39:41.040,0:39:43.200
shape

0:39:41.760,0:39:44.560
i want the one that's a hexagonal

0:39:43.200,0:39:46.720
looking shape out of math it's the

0:39:44.560,0:39:48.560
second one down

0:39:46.720,0:39:50.400
and what i want to do is i want to check

0:39:48.560,0:39:54.960
if my input

0:39:50.400,0:39:58.160
so i want to read digital pin 0

0:39:54.960,0:40:00.480
i want to see if he is equal to

0:39:58.160,0:40:02.640
so there's equal to uh i want to see if

0:40:00.480,0:40:06.160
he's equal to zero

0:40:02.640,0:40:08.960
because zero is a press um and so

0:40:06.160,0:40:09.680
if my button is pressed then show me

0:40:08.960,0:40:13.040
green

0:40:09.680,0:40:14.960
wait for three seconds show me uh yellow

0:40:13.040,0:40:17.680
wait for one second and then go back to

0:40:14.960,0:40:20.720
red time to try it

0:40:17.680,0:40:21.359
uh so if you run your simulation uh what

0:40:20.720,0:40:24.640
should happen

0:40:21.359,0:40:26.400
is it should just be a solid red led

0:40:24.640,0:40:27.760
and then if you press your button so if

0:40:26.400,0:40:31.040
i press the button here

0:40:27.760,0:40:33.599
uh it goes green uh and then yellow

0:40:31.040,0:40:34.800
and then red so that's exactly what this

0:40:33.599,0:40:36.240
circuit was doing

0:40:34.800,0:40:38.800
when you press the button it goes green

0:40:36.240,0:40:41.359
for a little bit

0:40:38.800,0:40:43.200
and then after your green cycle is done

0:40:41.359,0:40:46.480
it goes yellow and red

0:40:43.200,0:40:48.480
and the cool thing about um tinkercad is

0:40:46.480,0:40:50.880
it really is just a real circuit

0:40:48.480,0:40:52.319
so the way that i program that board

0:40:50.880,0:40:53.680
right there is i literally just took my

0:40:52.319,0:40:57.359
code right here

0:40:53.680,0:41:00.800
uh copied it to my clipboard um and

0:40:57.359,0:41:02.400
i opened up a program called the arduino

0:41:00.800,0:41:04.720
ide

0:41:02.400,0:41:05.520
and i just pasted it inside of here

0:41:04.720,0:41:07.200
right so

0:41:05.520,0:41:09.520
i think i already had it in here from

0:41:07.200,0:41:10.240
what i did earlier i paste it inside of

0:41:09.520,0:41:13.200
here

0:41:10.240,0:41:14.400
and then i program it to my board i'll

0:41:13.200,0:41:16.240
tell you what i want to i want to like

0:41:14.400,0:41:17.680
show that that it's really my code i'll

0:41:16.240,0:41:19.599
tell you what we'll make the green cycle

0:41:17.680,0:41:20.000
be like crazy long we'll use like seven

0:41:19.599,0:41:22.079
seconds

0:41:20.000,0:41:23.839
on the green cycle so we'll know that

0:41:22.079,0:41:25.760
it's actually the latest code

0:41:23.839,0:41:27.440
because it'll have that crazy long green

0:41:25.760,0:41:30.319
cycle

0:41:27.440,0:41:32.240
uh so now this new code is on my board

0:41:30.319,0:41:35.040
and so when i press it

0:41:32.240,0:41:36.160
it's gonna be green for seven seconds so

0:41:35.040,0:41:39.839
i'm gonna guess three

0:41:36.160,0:41:43.359
two one switch yeah that's pretty good

0:41:39.839,0:41:45.040
uh yellow and then red um so that is uh

0:41:43.359,0:41:48.640
what we're building today

0:41:45.040,0:41:50.800
um i love uh tinkercad circuits

0:41:48.640,0:41:52.319
it is such a good simulator we use it in

0:41:50.800,0:41:53.680
college classes right like when we're

0:41:52.319,0:41:55.760
teaching microcontrollers

0:41:53.680,0:41:57.280
because uh you can do everything in a

0:41:55.760,0:41:58.720
virtual environment

0:41:57.280,0:42:00.240
and you can learn even if you don't have

0:41:58.720,0:42:01.920
any hardware it's great for online

0:42:00.240,0:42:04.800
learning like we're doing here

0:42:01.920,0:42:06.240
and that is what we're up to today uh so

0:42:04.800,0:42:08.560
come back tomorrow

0:42:06.240,0:42:09.839
to learn some more about circuits

0:42:08.560,0:42:11.680
obviously if you want to play with

0:42:09.839,0:42:12.720
circuits just create something and start

0:42:11.680,0:42:14.560
start goofing around

0:42:12.720,0:42:16.720
we'll try to do some fun things tomorrow

0:42:14.560,0:42:18.720
too that i think you'll really enjoy

0:42:16.720,0:42:20.319
mckinley did you have fun today did you

0:42:18.720,0:42:23.280
get your finished circuit working

0:42:20.319,0:42:25.810
nope okay i'll have mckinley pictures

0:42:23.280,0:42:28.599
and i'll see you tomorrow

0:42:25.810,0:42:31.599
[Music]

0:42:28.599,0:42:31.599
bye
