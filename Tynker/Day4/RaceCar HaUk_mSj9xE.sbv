0:00:03.770,0:00:09.090
hey welcome to day four of the coding

0:00:06.420,0:00:11.700
camp I'm here with the the family again

0:00:09.090,0:00:14.340
today so we got keegan age eight

0:00:11.700,0:00:17.340
we've got mom and Bowen Bowen is age six

0:00:14.340,0:00:19.199
and then we've got sissy age ten you

0:00:17.340,0:00:22.230
guys ready to code some today mm-hmm all

0:00:19.199,0:00:23.850
right let's show a example of what we're

0:00:22.230,0:00:26.189
gonna be making today so we're gonna be

0:00:23.850,0:00:27.980
making a race car game today so here's

0:00:26.189,0:00:30.630
my race car he's going around the track

0:00:27.980,0:00:32.340
what we're gonna do is we're gonna draw

0:00:30.630,0:00:34.860
this car so we're gonna actually draw

0:00:32.340,0:00:37.410
the sprite ourselves the car is gonna

0:00:34.860,0:00:40.079
always be moving and I'm using the right

0:00:37.410,0:00:42.059
arrow to turn right and then the left

0:00:40.079,0:00:43.620
arrow to turn left and as you can

0:00:42.059,0:00:45.450
imagine the car is going around the

0:00:43.620,0:00:48.000
track at whatever speed you the programmer

0:00:45.450,0:00:49.770
design and if you touch the color

0:00:48.000,0:00:53.010
green which is around the outside and in the

0:00:49.770,0:00:55.050
middle then my car crashes and so it

0:00:53.010,0:00:57.270
crashed and it actually is playing a

0:00:55.050,0:00:58.770
little animation as well I really like

0:00:57.270,0:01:02.129
this project cause it's got a lot of

0:00:58.770,0:01:04.290
good enhancements here's an enhanced

0:01:02.129,0:01:06.900
version of one I made this is a

0:01:04.290,0:01:09.330
two-player game so like one person would

0:01:06.900,0:01:12.270
be the blue car and then the other

0:01:09.330,0:01:13.890
person would be the red car and they

0:01:12.270,0:01:15.479
would play against each other and you

0:01:13.890,0:01:17.640
can also do things like if you touch

0:01:15.479,0:01:20.159
these little red pills they speed you up

0:01:17.640,0:01:22.200
if you touch a green pill I'm sorry

0:01:20.159,0:01:23.490
green speeds you up and then red slows

0:01:22.200,0:01:25.049
you down there's all kinds of things you

0:01:23.490,0:01:27.119
could do you could even add things like

0:01:25.049,0:01:28.740
a finish line he would get there and win

0:01:27.119,0:01:31.409
but instead he's gonna crash

0:01:28.740,0:01:33.299
and so I like the different enhancements

0:01:31.409,0:01:34.320
and things you can make to this one so

0:01:33.299,0:01:36.270
let's go ahead and get started actually

0:01:34.320,0:01:37.710
building it some of the learning

0:01:36.270,0:01:38.460
objectives this time that are new is

0:01:37.710,0:01:40.979
we're going to be learning about

0:01:38.460,0:01:42.210
animations and functions so some really

0:01:40.979,0:01:44.399
important things today

0:01:42.210,0:01:46.860
so go and click on create new project

0:01:44.399,0:01:50.280
and like I always do I like to like on

0:01:46.860,0:01:51.720
blank block coding project so there's a

0:01:50.280,0:01:54.689
lot of different things that have to get

0:01:51.720,0:01:56.790
done we've got to draw the track we've

0:01:54.689,0:01:59.310
got to draw the car we've got to add the

0:01:56.790,0:02:00.540
code for the car can't really decide

0:01:59.310,0:02:02.369
where I want to start because there's so

0:02:00.540,0:02:04.049
much to do let's start with a little

0:02:02.369,0:02:06.540
drawing right so let's start with

0:02:04.049,0:02:08.789
drawing our car so we don't need the

0:02:06.540,0:02:09.319
monster he's a great actor but we don't

0:02:08.789,0:02:11.299
we don't need him

0:02:09.319,0:02:14.689
this time instead we're gonna add our

0:02:11.299,0:02:16.189
own actor we're gonna draw a car so I'm

0:02:14.689,0:02:19.340
gonna say add actor and I'm gonna say

0:02:16.189,0:02:21.499
drawing tool now everybody draws at

0:02:19.340,0:02:22.969
different speeds so what I'm gonna do is

0:02:21.499,0:02:25.099
I'm gonna kind of like quickly make mine

0:02:22.969,0:02:27.590
and then encourage you to pause the

0:02:25.099,0:02:29.090
video when you make yours so here's what

0:02:27.590,0:02:30.590
I'm gonna do the first thing I like to

0:02:29.090,0:02:32.870
do is I like to make sure I'm zoomed to

0:02:30.590,0:02:34.159
see the whole canvas my daughter

0:02:32.870,0:02:36.049
McKinley yelled at me just like why

0:02:34.159,0:02:37.819
don't you ever use the 75% button it's

0:02:36.049,0:02:39.139
right here in the middle and I said

0:02:37.819,0:02:40.189
because I didn't know about it thank you

0:02:39.139,0:02:41.450
for teaching me about it

0:02:40.189,0:02:43.549
so if you click in the middle you can

0:02:41.450,0:02:46.189
pick a zoom and 75% is it good zoom

0:02:43.549,0:02:47.569
for at least mine so what you want to do

0:02:46.189,0:02:50.150
is you want to decide what color you

0:02:47.569,0:02:51.889
want your car to be so I've been using

0:02:50.150,0:02:54.590
red as my car so I just kind of pick out

0:02:51.889,0:02:56.090
a red and like I said I'm gonna do this

0:02:54.590,0:02:59.780
kind of quick but what I like to do to make

0:02:56.090,0:03:02.090
a car is I like to draw a block which is

0:02:59.780,0:03:06.079
roughly in the middle and that's going

0:03:02.090,0:03:08.780
to be my car and then I draw a rectangle

0:03:06.079,0:03:10.400
kind of for the windows and so I'm gonna

0:03:08.780,0:03:11.840
go ahead and draw another rectangle here

0:03:10.400,0:03:14.090
because I had to click off that rectangle

0:03:11.840,0:03:16.759
a rectangle for the windows this is just

0:03:14.090,0:03:18.889
my style for my car if you want your car

0:03:16.759,0:03:20.989
to be entirely different that's fine and

0:03:18.889,0:03:22.939
then I want to draw that same color

0:03:20.989,0:03:26.540
again so I'm gonna use the eyedropper to

0:03:22.939,0:03:28.519
pick it back and then draw kind of like

0:03:26.540,0:03:30.590
another rectangle here and that may not

0:03:28.519,0:03:33.439
feel like a car at first it kind of is

0:03:30.590,0:03:34.549
gonna work out to be a car and so what

0:03:33.439,0:03:38.000
I'm gonna do is I'm going to draw some

0:03:34.549,0:03:41.000
lines to connect from the corners here

0:03:38.000,0:03:42.769
to the corners there and I think that

0:03:41.000,0:03:45.049
I'm starting to kind of have the feel of

0:03:42.769,0:03:48.199
the top view of a car so you want the

0:03:45.049,0:03:50.900
top view of a car a car is not a car

0:03:48.199,0:03:53.169
until you have tires that's what I'm

0:03:50.900,0:03:55.579
gonna do is I'm gonna make my tires and

0:03:53.169,0:03:57.530
whenever I make something I still select

0:03:55.579,0:03:59.959
it that's an opportunity to hit ctrl-c

0:03:57.530,0:04:01.699
ctrl-v and you can make another one of

0:03:59.959,0:04:05.689
them so if you want to you can kind of like

0:04:01.699,0:04:08.359
copy paste your tires again I know that

0:04:05.689,0:04:10.819
this is way too fast for you to directly

0:04:08.359,0:04:14.060
follow along but I'm trying to kind of

0:04:10.819,0:04:16.430
show you the the basics and then once

0:04:14.060,0:04:18.919
you've got your four tires on I consider

0:04:16.430,0:04:20.750
that good enough right if you want to

0:04:18.919,0:04:23.120
make enhancements to it like you want to

0:04:20.750,0:04:24.919
add headlights or you want to add taillights

0:04:23.120,0:04:28.310
that's fine but I think that this is a

0:04:24.919,0:04:32.030
perfectly acceptable car so now I'm

0:04:28.310,0:04:36.710
gonna name my costume right now it's

0:04:32.030,0:04:38.660
called blank I'm gonna name it car and

0:04:36.710,0:04:41.210
I'm gonna go and hit save just so that I

0:04:38.660,0:04:42.680
can save my current car and now what I

0:04:41.210,0:04:44.690
want to do is I want to make another

0:04:42.680,0:04:46.580
so pause the video until you make

0:04:44.690,0:04:48.290
your car alright pause the video make

0:04:46.580,0:04:51.080
your car alright now we've all got a car

0:04:48.290,0:04:54.169
so now I want to make another version of

0:04:51.080,0:04:56.810
the car that's crashed right so a crash

0:04:54.169,0:04:58.669
car so to make another version of

0:04:56.810,0:05:00.710
something right now it's selected up

0:04:58.669,0:05:03.169
here I'm gonna click on this copy button

0:05:00.710,0:05:04.340
right so when I click on copy it makes a

0:05:03.169,0:05:10.130
copy of my car

0:05:04.340,0:05:11.870
this next car I'm gonna call crash now

0:05:10.130,0:05:14.750
there's a bunch of ways to crash a car

0:05:11.870,0:05:17.900
you could just scribble on it with lines

0:05:14.750,0:05:19.460
that's certainly a fine way to to crash

0:05:17.900,0:05:20.600
a car you know so you could just kind of

0:05:19.460,0:05:22.699
scribble all over it

0:05:20.600,0:05:24.020
you can make you know orange flames on

0:05:22.699,0:05:26.030
top of it oops I thought I was gonna

0:05:24.020,0:05:27.770
change colors there orange flames on

0:05:26.030,0:05:29.419
it and that's kind of crashing as well

0:05:27.770,0:05:32.210
there's another trick that I find fun

0:05:29.419,0:05:34.789
this selection tool you can kind of like

0:05:32.210,0:05:38.330
select a wedge of your car and then just

0:05:34.789,0:05:39.680
kind of like move it or rotate it and I

0:05:38.330,0:05:41.570
find that that's always a really good

0:05:39.680,0:05:43.789
way to kind of like make something have

0:05:41.570,0:05:48.020
an appearance of you know you just got

0:05:43.789,0:05:49.550
crashed right so and if you wanted to go

0:05:48.020,0:05:50.120
crazy I know that every time I teach

0:05:49.550,0:05:52.789
this class

0:05:50.120,0:05:54.260
somebody just completely explodes their

0:05:52.789,0:05:56.720
car there's nothing wrong with that

0:05:54.260,0:05:58.070
right it personally I think it looks

0:05:56.720,0:06:00.139
better if it's kind of close to a car

0:05:58.070,0:06:03.500
still but you do whatever makes you

0:06:00.139,0:06:05.419
happy so there's my crash car so pause

0:06:03.500,0:06:07.250
the video until you have these two

0:06:05.419,0:06:08.539
animations by the way you can hit the play

0:06:07.250,0:06:11.270
button here and it'll just kind of show

0:06:08.539,0:06:13.039
you like here's normal here's crashed so

0:06:11.270,0:06:15.530
when you hit a wall you're gonna switch

0:06:13.039,0:06:17.900
to that crash alright so I'm gonna save

0:06:15.530,0:06:21.139
that up and I'm gonna head back to my

0:06:17.900,0:06:22.820
game now my car is currently much too

0:06:21.139,0:06:27.110
big for a track right so I'm gonna have

0:06:22.820,0:06:28.370
to make my car much smaller and again

0:06:27.110,0:06:29.840
this is why I encourage you not to

0:06:28.370,0:06:31.219
necessarily go nuts with drawing 

0:06:29.840,0:06:33.590
headlights and stuff because once your

0:06:31.219,0:06:35.130
car is small enough you can only see so

0:06:33.590,0:06:37.510
many of those details

0:06:35.130,0:06:40.090
while we're still in the drawing mood

0:06:37.510,0:06:43.300
we've still got to draw a track so let's go

0:06:40.090,0:06:48.450
ahead and draw a track really quick so

0:06:43.300,0:06:50.590
click on the stage say add background

0:06:48.450,0:06:53.500
click on the paintbrush because we're

0:06:50.590,0:06:58.120
gonna draw our track and say draw an

0:06:53.500,0:07:00.520
image now your track let me get this 75%

0:06:58.120,0:07:02.620
thanks to McKinley your track is gonna

0:07:00.520,0:07:04.660
need to have a border around the outside

0:07:02.620,0:07:06.610
so people can't just like drive off into

0:07:04.660,0:07:08.230
space and it's gonna have something in

0:07:06.610,0:07:09.760
the middle and it's going to have enough

0:07:08.230,0:07:11.620
room that you can actually get around

0:07:09.760,0:07:13.780
but other than that you can do whatever

0:07:11.620,0:07:15.040
you want so what I'm going to choose to

0:07:13.780,0:07:17.980
do is I'm going to make a border around

0:07:15.040,0:07:22.990
the outside that's maybe like 10 pixels

0:07:17.980,0:07:24.760
in thickness I'm gonna choose a like

0:07:22.990,0:07:27.700
maybe a green color of some sort

0:07:24.760,0:07:29.410
maybe I'll choose like a dark green by the way

0:07:27.700,0:07:31.090
this hex value is gonna be 

0:07:29.410,0:07:34.840
useful later but I'll just wait until

0:07:31.090,0:07:36.490
later before I worry about that to

0:07:34.840,0:07:39.220
make a border around the outside I like

0:07:36.490,0:07:41.890
to draw it to be nearly big enough maybe

0:07:39.220,0:07:43.330
I'll make it perfectly big enough if you

0:07:41.890,0:07:45.490
make it perfect then great you're done

0:07:43.330,0:07:47.680
if it's not quite perfect you just have

0:07:45.490,0:07:49.000
to grab these little handles and just

0:07:47.680,0:07:51.610
scooch it all the way till there's

0:07:49.000,0:07:53.080
nothing showing on the outside this is

0:07:51.610,0:07:54.970
the same thing that we did for the maze

0:07:53.080,0:07:57.310
so hopefully it's something you're

0:07:54.970,0:08:00.010
familiar with now we need to draw

0:07:57.310,0:08:02.169
something in the middle the middle can

0:08:00.010,0:08:05.100
be whatever you'd like if you wanted to

0:08:02.169,0:08:08.080
kind of be rectangular you can do that

0:08:05.100,0:08:11.050
if you would rather it kind of be oval

0:08:08.080,0:08:13.000
based you know you can do that but it

0:08:11.050,0:08:14.860
should be a track that people can you

0:08:13.000,0:08:16.960
know get around right so maybe I'll make

0:08:14.860,0:08:18.550
them kind of go through there and then

0:08:16.960,0:08:22.360
up through here but they should be able

0:08:18.550,0:08:23.860
to drive around it your car is only so

0:08:22.360,0:08:26.650
big so you might want to give yourself

0:08:23.860,0:08:28.780
some some space to kind of drive things

0:08:26.650,0:08:31.360
around right maybe I'll add another

0:08:28.780,0:08:34.750
little hump here if you'd like to keep

0:08:31.360,0:08:37.150
the background white that's fine but if

0:08:34.750,0:08:39.219
you'd like to use a fill and make it

0:08:37.150,0:08:40.210
kind of like a gray color that's also

0:08:39.219,0:08:44.200
fine whatever you prefer

0:08:40.210,0:08:46.140
also feel free to decorate I always

0:08:44.200,0:08:47.329
like to put my name on things right so

0:08:46.140,0:08:53.989
this

0:08:47.329,0:08:58.069
is dr. Fisher's track we'll go with the more

0:08:53.989,0:08:59.480
formal dr. Fischer right it always

0:08:58.069,0:09:00.439
likes to drop down a little bit at the

0:08:59.480,0:09:02.929
end though oh well I'll consider that a

0:09:00.439,0:09:05.119
feature this time and I think that that

0:09:02.929,0:09:08.239
looks looks good enough for me

0:09:05.119,0:09:09.799
so pause it as you need and make sure that

0:09:08.239,0:09:11.749
you've got some type of track that you

0:09:09.799,0:09:14.899
can get around and then go ahead and hit

0:09:11.749,0:09:18.470
save all right so now we're ready to

0:09:14.899,0:09:19.699
start in with the code drawing

0:09:18.470,0:09:21.589
is definitely a useful skill I

0:09:19.699,0:09:22.759
definitely want you to do it but I think

0:09:21.589,0:09:24.799
we're good enough that you don't have to

0:09:22.759,0:09:26.329
watch me do it anymore you can just

0:09:24.799,0:09:28.790
start making them yourself

0:09:26.329,0:09:29.839
so now it's time for the code so here

0:09:28.790,0:09:34.489
you will have to kind of follow along

0:09:29.839,0:09:36.049
with me click on the car if it bothers

0:09:34.489,0:09:38.929
you the name of my car is

0:09:36.049,0:09:43.249
currently actor so I'm gonna rename him

0:09:38.929,0:09:44.809
race car Oh while I'm naming things I

0:09:43.249,0:09:46.549
should probably save my project I

0:09:44.809,0:09:48.709
usually forget to do this until like

0:09:46.549,0:09:51.860
way later but you really should save

0:09:48.709,0:09:56.929
early and save often right so I'm just

0:09:51.860,0:09:58.579
gonna call it race car track I don't

0:09:56.929,0:10:01.220
want to publish it yet I'll publish it

0:09:58.579,0:10:02.209
later I just wanted to go ahead and save

0:10:01.220,0:10:03.649
it early because I've done a lot of

0:10:02.209,0:10:06.470
drawing right and I don't want to lose

0:10:03.649,0:10:09.379
all my drawings but now I'm ready to add

0:10:06.470,0:10:12.559
some code to my race car so my race car

0:10:09.379,0:10:14.540
needs an on start we've done that many

0:10:12.559,0:10:15.709
times and in our projects that's

0:10:14.540,0:10:18.230
just as soon as you hit the start button

0:10:15.709,0:10:20.419
that's stuff that happens and we want

0:10:18.230,0:10:22.220
some things to happen forever so we're

0:10:20.419,0:10:26.029
gonna add a forever loop so go to

0:10:22.220,0:10:31.639
control and go ahead and grab a forever

0:10:26.029,0:10:33.619
loop and we want to do things like we

0:10:31.639,0:10:35.959
want to check to see if the user is

0:10:33.619,0:10:38.239
telling us to turn we want to move

0:10:35.959,0:10:40.429
forwards we want to check to see if

0:10:38.239,0:10:42.410
we're crashed and then of course we have

0:10:40.429,0:10:43.790
to add that that wait so that our loop

0:10:42.410,0:10:46.819
doesn't happen like too fast

0:10:43.790,0:10:48.410
now normally we just go grab the code

0:10:46.819,0:10:50.569
and just put it in here and there's

0:10:48.410,0:10:51.739
nothing wrong with that but today I want

0:10:50.569,0:10:53.629
to teach you something new about

0:10:51.739,0:10:55.520
functions click on the button that says

0:10:53.629,0:10:57.800
functions

0:10:55.520,0:11:01.220
today's game we're going to make using

0:10:57.800,0:11:03.260
functions functions are good for making

0:11:01.220,0:11:05.300
code that you can reuse it's also good

0:11:03.260,0:11:06.589
for organization so what is a function

0:11:05.300,0:11:09.070
let's go ahead and make one we'll learn

0:11:06.589,0:11:11.779
about it so click on create function

0:11:09.070,0:11:13.730
we're gonna make a function and here you

0:11:11.779,0:11:19.459
have to do some typing that says check

0:11:13.730,0:11:21.200
for turns with functions in tinker you

0:11:19.459,0:11:23.300
can use capital letters you can use

0:11:21.200,0:11:24.709
lowercase letters you can put spaces in

0:11:23.300,0:11:27.290
the name of the function doesn't matter

0:11:24.709,0:11:31.399
I'm going to make mine check for turns

0:11:27.290,0:11:33.500
and just use spaces as appropriate now a

0:11:31.399,0:11:34.490
function can also have parameters we're

0:11:33.500,0:11:36.620
not going to worry about that today

0:11:34.490,0:11:38.480
maybe tomorrow we'll do that with our

0:11:36.620,0:11:42.230
with our stars right but check for turns

0:11:38.480,0:11:44.720
and click on create now when you click

0:11:42.230,0:11:48.410
on create something happens and they

0:11:44.720,0:11:51.350
make for you a spot for this function

0:11:48.410,0:11:53.390
now usually it shows up right on my

0:11:51.350,0:11:55.220
screen and I can see it but if somehow

0:11:53.390,0:11:57.350
you don't see that just like zoom out

0:11:55.220,0:11:59.660
until you find it and then move it to

0:11:57.350,0:12:02.420
where you can see it but what's gonna

0:11:59.660,0:12:05.000
happen here is under this check for 

0:12:02.420,0:12:06.350
turns I'm going to put some code and

0:12:05.000,0:12:07.940
then whenever I want to call that

0:12:06.350,0:12:09.500
function I'll have to call up from my

0:12:07.940,0:12:11.660
main loop let's go ahead and write the

0:12:09.500,0:12:15.140
function together and then we'll call it from 

0:12:11.660,0:12:17.149
our main loop so check for turns a check

0:12:15.140,0:12:18.709
is an if statement so we know we're

0:12:17.149,0:12:21.980
gonna have to add some if statements to

0:12:18.709,0:12:23.750
this function we're gonna need a grand

0:12:21.980,0:12:26.329
total of two if statements so I'm going to

0:12:23.750,0:12:29.029
move over one if statement and I'm

0:12:26.329,0:12:30.940
building up this function right and then

0:12:29.029,0:12:35.120
I'm going to bring another if statement

0:12:30.940,0:12:37.579
also into my function now it currently says

0:12:35.120,0:12:39.680
if false then but really this is just a

0:12:37.579,0:12:42.890
placeholder so if some condition happens

0:12:39.680,0:12:45.589
then run this code the condition we're

0:12:42.890,0:12:52.100
looking for is the user pressing the

0:12:45.589,0:12:53.360
left arrow so let's go to sensing and

0:12:52.100,0:12:57.380
what we're looking for is we're looking

0:12:53.360,0:12:58.940
for are they pressing a key right so

0:12:57.380,0:13:01.610
really what we want to do is we want

0:12:58.940,0:13:05.120
like pressing some key and down here is

0:13:01.610,0:13:07.370
a good one key up arrow pressed now

0:13:05.120,0:13:08.720
that's the wrong key but you can see

0:13:07.370,0:13:09.230
that that's probably a good starting

0:13:08.720,0:13:11.620
point

0:13:09.230,0:13:17.990
and we don't want to check the up-arrow

0:13:11.620,0:13:19.820
we want to check the left arrow and then

0:13:17.990,0:13:26.080
for the other one we want to also check

0:13:19.820,0:13:28.340
a key and we're gonna do the right arrow

0:13:26.080,0:13:29.390
now I'm moving a little bit fast today I

0:13:28.340,0:13:31.790
don't know I guess it's just warm

0:13:29.390,0:13:34.010
outside but feel free to pause the video

0:13:31.790,0:13:36.230
if I'm doing things too too quickly

0:13:34.010,0:13:38.450
right so I've got a function over here

0:13:36.230,0:13:39.590
I'll make it so can see all my code I've got a

0:13:38.450,0:13:41.960
function over here with two if

0:13:39.590,0:13:44.060
statements in it and right now I'm

0:13:41.960,0:13:45.440
making this function first but I'm not

0:13:44.060,0:13:47.900
actually calling this function we're

0:13:45.440,0:13:49.700
gonna get to that in a second so this

0:13:47.900,0:13:53.690
function if you're touching the left

0:13:49.700,0:13:55.670
arrow we want to turn to the left some

0:13:53.690,0:14:01.760
number of degrees right so let's go

0:13:55.670,0:14:04.000
ahead and find motion and so if I'm

0:14:01.760,0:14:06.110
pressing left arrow I want to turn left

0:14:04.000,0:14:08.390
so you gotta kind of like look at the

0:14:06.110,0:14:12.230
little arrows on here and if I was a car

0:14:08.390,0:14:15.050
this bottom one is a left turn and then

0:14:12.230,0:14:21.470
this top one this top one is my right

0:14:15.050,0:14:22.820
turn great now the amount 15 degrees you

0:14:21.470,0:14:24.920
just have to kind of play with it and

0:14:22.820,0:14:27.950
see see how it goes it depends on how

0:14:24.920,0:14:30.380
fast your your timing is so I'm just

0:14:27.950,0:14:31.730
gonna leave it as 15 for now and if I

0:14:30.380,0:14:35.150
have to change it later I have to change

0:14:31.730,0:14:37.610
it later so now we've written a function

0:14:35.150,0:14:39.260
so if we ever want to use this code we

0:14:37.610,0:14:43.660
can call this function let's go ahead

0:14:39.260,0:14:46.610
and do that so go back to functions and

0:14:43.660,0:14:50.210
this check for turns function that we've

0:14:46.610,0:14:52.790
made we want to call it as the first

0:14:50.210,0:14:56.150
thing in our forever loop so the first

0:14:52.790,0:14:58.010
thing we do is we check for turns so now

0:14:56.150,0:15:00.230
the way our code works is it it hits

0:14:58.010,0:15:03.650
that function call it hops over to this

0:15:00.230,0:15:05.840
function and it runs it and then control

0:15:03.650,0:15:07.700
comes back over here now the next thing

0:15:05.840,0:15:10.370
I want to do after I check for turns is

0:15:07.700,0:15:11.870
I want to move the car forward so now

0:15:10.370,0:15:15.250
I've kind of like done my steering I

0:15:11.870,0:15:20.800
want to move it forwards that's in motion

0:15:15.250,0:15:20.800
I want to move 10 pixels

0:15:21.200,0:15:29.120
now after I move 10 pixels what I want

0:15:25.490,0:15:30.680
to do is I want to check for a crash and

0:15:29.120,0:15:33.200
then I want to have a short time delay

0:15:30.680,0:15:35.690
let's add the time delay and test it and

0:15:33.200,0:15:37.850
then we'll worry about crashes later so

0:15:35.690,0:15:40.579
let's add that time delay time delays

0:15:37.850,0:15:44.170
are over in control they're near the

0:15:40.579,0:15:44.170
bottom but not all the way to the bottom

0:15:44.769,0:15:50.029
and it says wait one second and I'm

0:15:48.290,0:15:51.769
going to pop that in there now one

0:15:50.029,0:15:54.170
second is a very long time that would

0:15:51.769,0:15:55.699
make your game feel very like jumpy so

0:15:54.170,0:16:00.800
we're going to use the the number that

0:15:55.699,0:16:04.100
we've used in the past and that's 0.05

0:16:00.800,0:16:05.839
that's one twentieth of a second it

0:16:04.100,0:16:10.070
makes your game play at 20 frames per

0:16:05.839,0:16:12.019
second essentially so let's try it if it

0:16:10.070,0:16:13.730
all works what should happen is you

0:16:12.019,0:16:16.880
should be able to steer your car around

0:16:13.730,0:16:19.370
using the left and right arrow now you

0:16:16.880,0:16:22.220
can decide for you what you want to do

0:16:19.370,0:16:24.459
about speeds so right now the speed is

0:16:22.220,0:16:27.649
that he's going forwards at 10 pixels

0:16:24.459,0:16:30.620
and he's turning at 15 degrees now

0:16:27.649,0:16:33.199
that's actually kind of a slow turn

0:16:30.620,0:16:36.320
sorry kind of a slow speed but kind of a

0:16:33.199,0:16:38.209
fast turn right if you like that leave

0:16:36.320,0:16:39.980
it right you don't you don't have to

0:16:38.209,0:16:40.399
change it if you want to tweak it a

0:16:39.980,0:16:42.320
little bit

0:16:40.399,0:16:46.970
feel free to tweak it so if you wanted

0:16:42.320,0:16:49.190
to say move at 15 you could if you

0:16:46.970,0:16:51.620
wanted to turn a little less hard you

0:16:49.190,0:16:53.060
could take those 15s down to tens and

0:16:51.620,0:16:57.199
you could see what that was like right

0:16:53.060,0:17:00.440
so now I don't turn as sharp but I move

0:16:57.199,0:17:03.260
kind of faster right so with your track

0:17:00.440,0:17:05.990
and your car decide what you want your

0:17:03.260,0:17:07.160
speeds to be and then just whatever you

0:17:05.990,0:17:09.919
decide you want it to be that's where

0:17:07.160,0:17:12.679
you leave it cool so I think it's

0:17:09.919,0:17:16.819
looking pretty good so let's go ahead

0:17:12.679,0:17:21.500
and add some more stuff I'm gonna click

0:17:16.819,0:17:24.620
save really quick so we use this

0:17:21.500,0:17:26.959
function purely for organization right

0:17:24.620,0:17:30.890
so it makes our main loop easier to read

0:17:26.959,0:17:33.340
so it says check for turns move 15 now

0:17:30.890,0:17:35.350
we want to check for crash

0:17:33.340,0:17:42.850
lets make another function so click on

0:17:35.350,0:17:49.630
functions create function and we'll call

0:17:42.850,0:17:51.340
this one check for crash again you could

0:17:49.630,0:17:53.860
actually name your function anything you

0:17:51.340,0:17:56.770
wanted upper case lower case using

0:17:53.860,0:18:00.220
spaces doesn't matter in Tynker just

0:17:56.770,0:18:01.510
pick a name that you like and you'll see

0:18:00.220,0:18:04.030
I can kind of see mine sticking out over

0:18:01.510,0:18:07.630
here you'll see that it adds a function

0:18:04.030,0:18:09.040
stub for you so make sure you find that

0:18:07.630,0:18:10.120
stub right because that's that's

0:18:09.040,0:18:13.180
important that's where we gonna put your

0:18:10.120,0:18:14.860
function now just to be different this

0:18:13.180,0:18:16.960
time let's go ahead and call the

0:18:14.860,0:18:19.750
function first and then we'll write the

0:18:16.960,0:18:23.080
function second so to call the function

0:18:19.750,0:18:24.450
you take this check for crash you can

0:18:23.080,0:18:26.890
kind of see how it's a different shape

0:18:24.450,0:18:30.070
I'm gonna choose to put it right between

0:18:26.890,0:18:32.620
the move and the time delay does it have

0:18:30.070,0:18:33.910
to go there not really it can go about

0:18:32.620,0:18:35.110
anywhere in the loop because it doesn't

0:18:33.910,0:18:36.970
matter what order you do these things

0:18:35.110,0:18:38.950
they come around so fast that it'll

0:18:36.970,0:18:42.610
check for the crash pretty often but I'm

0:18:38.950,0:18:45.040
gonna check right after I move now if

0:18:42.610,0:18:48.130
you were to play your game right now it

0:18:45.040,0:18:50.080
would not check for crashes all it would do

0:18:48.130,0:18:53.230
is it would call the function check for

0:18:50.080,0:18:55.360
crash which is empty and then carry on

0:18:53.230,0:18:57.640
with life right so functions aren't

0:18:55.360,0:18:59.500
magic just because you say hey call a

0:18:57.640,0:19:01.360
function that says check for crash it

0:18:59.500,0:19:03.310
doesn't just do it it does whatever code

0:19:01.360,0:19:07.300
you've got there so let's go ahead and

0:19:03.310,0:19:09.790
add some code inside check for crash so

0:19:07.300,0:19:12.210
in order to do this you need a pencil

0:19:09.790,0:19:14.440
and paper which I forgot again today so

0:19:12.210,0:19:16.990
I'm gonna pause the video and go get a

0:19:14.440,0:19:19.990
pencil and paper I'll be right back alright

0:19:16.990,0:19:22.330
I've got my pencil and paper magically

0:19:19.990,0:19:24.220
instantly and so what we need to do is

0:19:22.330,0:19:27.250
we're going to need to check if we're

0:19:24.220,0:19:28.660
touching the color of the track so I

0:19:27.250,0:19:30.820
know that I'm going to need that color

0:19:28.660,0:19:32.860
so I'm just going to go get it first so

0:19:30.820,0:19:35.530
to go get that color you can click on

0:19:32.860,0:19:37.210
the pencil icon for the stage because

0:19:35.530,0:19:38.980
there is this there is a costume there

0:19:37.210,0:19:41.170
you can just click on the pencil and we

0:19:38.980,0:19:43.690
need to figure out what color is my

0:19:41.170,0:19:44.570
track and simultaneously what color is

0:19:43.690,0:19:46.850
my outside wall

0:19:44.570,0:19:52.130
so this game is simple you click on the

0:19:46.850,0:19:55.550
eyedropper you click on your color you

0:19:52.130,0:19:59.960
click on the the multicolored tool and

0:19:55.550,0:20:03.950
then you say hex still cracks me up so

0:19:59.960,0:20:06.860
write down your color mine appears

0:20:03.950,0:20:09.830
to be that crazy combination of letters

0:20:06.860,0:20:12.590
and numbers again the letters are going

0:20:09.830,0:20:14.360
to be a through F so you don't have to

0:20:12.590,0:20:17.240
worry about like is that a zero is that

0:20:14.360,0:20:18.860
O (letter) it's a zero because it can't be now

0:20:17.240,0:20:21.170
alright so now we're gonna check for

0:20:18.860,0:20:25.430
crash checking for something is an if

0:20:21.170,0:20:27.320
statement so we're gonna say if so it's

0:20:25.430,0:20:30.590
in control that's the top one in control

0:20:27.320,0:20:33.200
so if this condition then run this code

0:20:30.590,0:20:37.250
the condition we want to check for is in

0:20:33.200,0:20:42.680
sensing we want to check if we're

0:20:37.250,0:20:45.230
touching a color and then this is where

0:20:42.680,0:20:47.690
you need to type in that number that you

0:20:45.230,0:20:48.980
wrote down these boxes are always kind

0:20:47.690,0:20:51.620
of annoying I find that if I click at

0:20:48.980,0:20:54.380
the end of it and I just backspace over

0:20:51.620,0:20:58.400
it oops alright so I'll type in my

0:20:54.380,0:20:59.930
number here and again you might have to

0:20:58.400,0:21:01.400
fight with this box some until you get it

0:20:59.930,0:21:03.320
use the left and right arrow keys to

0:21:01.400,0:21:04.820
kind of navigate back and forth and

0:21:03.320,0:21:07.970
delete key until you work it out now

0:21:04.820,0:21:09.830
you'll know that it works because it's

0:21:07.970,0:21:11.120
gonna match the color perfectly right so

0:21:09.830,0:21:12.770
at least you do get that confirmation

0:21:11.120,0:21:15.410
before you run your code that yeah it's

0:21:12.770,0:21:18.650
gonna work right all right so now if we

0:21:15.410,0:21:20.510
are touching that color what do we want

0:21:18.650,0:21:25.070
to have happen well we want to switch

0:21:20.510,0:21:27.710
our costume to that crash costume we

0:21:25.070,0:21:29.990
also want to decide like do we want to

0:21:27.710,0:21:32.240
just end the game outright or what do we

0:21:29.990,0:21:34.880
want to do for now we will just end

0:21:32.240,0:21:36.980
the game like after a short pause so

0:21:34.880,0:21:41.240
let's go ahead and switch costumes so

0:21:36.980,0:21:44.420
that's going to be in looks and we're

0:21:41.240,0:21:47.210
going to say switch costume switch to

0:21:44.420,0:21:49.850
costume and now if you named your

0:21:47.210,0:21:53.420
costumes they'll have good names I was

0:21:49.850,0:21:57.200
good I named mine car and crash so I'm

0:21:53.420,0:21:58.150
gonna say switch costume to crash now

0:21:57.200,0:22:00.130
whenever I start dealing

0:21:58.150,0:22:02.500
with costumes like this like if I switch

0:22:00.130,0:22:04.990
to crash later I find that it's always

0:22:02.500,0:22:08.200
good practice to switch to your normal

0:22:04.990,0:22:10.360
car right on the start up sometimes it

0:22:08.200,0:22:13.090
turns out not to be necessary but I

0:22:10.360,0:22:14.320
always welcome doing it so here's what

0:22:13.090,0:22:17.610
I'm gonna do I'm gonna grab another

0:22:14.320,0:22:21.400
switch to costume and I'm gonna put it

0:22:17.610,0:22:23.680
between on start and forever this is a

0:22:21.400,0:22:25.960
good place to do kind of like your set

0:22:23.680,0:22:28.270
up work right and so in this area we're

0:22:25.960,0:22:30.610
gonna switch to the car so that way

0:22:28.270,0:22:31.060
even if it's got crashed in a previous

0:22:30.610,0:22:33.070
round

0:22:31.060,0:22:34.300
it'll be reset now what we're actually

0:22:33.070,0:22:36.850
going to do is we're just going to end

0:22:34.300,0:22:43.480
the game if that happens ending the game

0:22:36.850,0:22:46.300
is in control and we scroll down and

0:22:43.480,0:22:47.590
we're gonna grab this stop all now we're

0:22:46.300,0:22:49.540
going to come up with a better thing to

0:22:47.590,0:22:51.190
do after a while but for now just to

0:22:49.540,0:22:52.600
kind of test it this is what we want to

0:22:51.190,0:22:56.080
happen so we're gonna switch to costume

0:22:52.600,0:22:58.300
crash and then the game's gonna stop now

0:22:56.080,0:23:00.040
I happen to know that there's a bug here

0:22:58.300,0:23:01.930
and the bug is is that as soon as the

0:23:00.040,0:23:04.000
game ends as soon as stop all happens

0:23:01.930,0:23:05.440
then you don't see anything else it

0:23:04.000,0:23:07.060
just resets to the beginning so I want to

0:23:05.440,0:23:09.430
actually wait for a little bit between

0:23:07.060,0:23:11.290
those two activities maybe I'll wait for

0:23:09.430,0:23:15.250
like three seconds so that way you can

0:23:11.290,0:23:16.930
see your car in its crash mode and then

0:23:15.250,0:23:20.640
you can actually know that you're crashed

0:23:16.930,0:23:20.640
so now I'm going to go in and hit play

0:23:20.700,0:23:25.990
and I'm gonna intentionally just crash

0:23:23.290,0:23:27.790
right into a wall cool and so I can see

0:23:25.990,0:23:30.700
that I've got a nice little car crash

0:23:27.790,0:23:32.410
which is fun and then my game did stop

0:23:30.700,0:23:34.900
so the only way I can play it again is

0:23:32.410,0:23:38.680
by hitting the button again and then you

0:23:34.900,0:23:40.900
can race it around your track and you

0:23:38.680,0:23:45.310
can see how how long you can make it

0:23:40.900,0:23:49.300
right and if you hit the outsides

0:23:45.310,0:23:50.860
that should make you crash as well by

0:23:49.300,0:23:58.630
the way you can also add sound effects

0:23:50.860,0:24:00.490
sound effects are fun oops hold on I did not mean to do that and so if you want

0:23:58.630,0:24:03.850
to add a sound effect that can be a fun

0:24:00.490,0:24:05.320
thing to do to add a sound effect we

0:24:03.850,0:24:09.630
have kind of tried to play with this

0:24:05.320,0:24:12.360
before you can click on the racecar here

0:24:09.630,0:24:16.510
you can go into sounds

0:24:12.360,0:24:19.660
and you can add a sound now you can add

0:24:16.510,0:24:23.170
sounds from their library you can look

0:24:19.660,0:24:24.700
around and play sounds and so what you

0:24:23.170,0:24:26.320
could what you could do is you could do

0:24:24.700,0:24:29.020
a search if you want to look for

0:24:26.320,0:24:31.030
something so if you want to add it you

0:24:29.020,0:24:32.560
click on the top icon if you just want

0:24:31.030,0:24:34.840
to play it you just hit the play button

0:24:32.560,0:24:36.910
below it right and so that's that's the

0:24:34.840,0:24:41.110
way that works so I'm going to choose to

0:24:36.910,0:24:44.350
add an explosion and what that does is

0:24:41.110,0:24:46.240
that much like costumes that makes it a

0:24:44.350,0:24:49.930
costume I can use this makes it a sound

0:24:46.240,0:24:53.530
I can use now I can use that sound

0:24:49.930,0:24:56.110
effect in my code right so what I'm

0:24:53.530,0:24:57.580
going to do is I've now got the ability

0:24:56.110,0:25:01.240
to use that sound effect I'm going to go

0:24:57.580,0:25:03.460
into the sound area and there's two

0:25:01.240,0:25:05.620
types of sounds there's play sound until

0:25:03.460,0:25:08.620
done that would be a fine one to use or

0:25:05.620,0:25:12.960
there's just play sound right now

0:25:08.620,0:25:15.550
I'm just gonna play sound explosion and

0:25:12.960,0:25:18.970
so now what you can do is you to try

0:25:15.550,0:25:23.770
your game again and now when you crash

0:25:18.970,0:25:26.260
your car you should hear a sound and see

0:25:23.770,0:25:28.750
the costume change now you probably

0:25:26.260,0:25:30.820
can't hear my sound because of I'm set

0:25:28.750,0:25:32.590
up here to record audio but it should

0:25:30.820,0:25:35.020
work for you right so you should be able

0:25:32.590,0:25:37.380
to crash your car you should be able to

0:25:35.020,0:25:39.790
hear a sound and then see the crash

0:25:37.380,0:25:42.220
alright so now we're ready to add the

0:25:39.790,0:25:45.310
final cool feature instead of just

0:25:42.220,0:25:47.140
switching to one costume which is our

0:25:45.310,0:25:49.300
crash costume and stopping the game

0:25:47.140,0:25:51.190
we're gonna play an animation animations

0:25:49.300,0:25:53.530
are really fun so here's what I want you

0:25:51.190,0:25:56.140
to do I want you to take these three

0:25:53.530,0:25:58.330
lines of code switch costume wait for

0:25:56.140,0:26:00.010
three seconds and stop all and just kind

0:25:58.330,0:26:02.410
of like set them over to the side right

0:26:00.010,0:26:03.670
so we're well actually you could delete them

0:26:02.410,0:26:06.010
because we don't really need them

0:26:03.670,0:26:07.090
anymore but I like to keep code around

0:26:06.010,0:26:09.160
because I went to all the trouble of

0:26:07.090,0:26:12.730
writing it and instead we're going to

0:26:09.160,0:26:14.890
play a crash animation now just for the

0:26:12.730,0:26:17.860
sake of practicing with functions let's

0:26:14.890,0:26:22.330
make another function called play crash

0:26:17.860,0:26:25.720
animation so go to functions create a

0:26:22.330,0:26:30.519
function play

0:26:25.720,0:26:31.830
crash animation so we're learning about

0:26:30.519,0:26:35.289
two things we're learning about

0:26:31.830,0:26:36.820
functions play crash animation the

0:26:35.289,0:26:38.590
function and we're also going to learn

0:26:36.820,0:26:40.750
about animations right so kind of kind

0:26:38.590,0:26:41.590
of a neat a little double dip so the

0:26:40.750,0:26:43.419
first thing you got to do is you're

0:26:41.590,0:26:46.659
going to go find the the start of your

0:26:43.419,0:26:49.330
function so let me get my code organized

0:26:46.659,0:26:51.039
here so you can see that functions can

0:26:49.330,0:26:53.379
be good just for kind of like describing

0:26:51.039,0:26:55.509
what's happening so I want to play this

0:26:53.379,0:26:57.309
explosion and then play a crash

0:26:55.509,0:26:58.720
animation I'm gonna do the same thing I 

0:26:57.309,0:27:01.029
did last time I'm gonna call the

0:26:58.720,0:27:03.669
function first so the way you call a

0:27:01.029,0:27:06.370
function is it kind of makes a block for

0:27:03.669,0:27:08.500
you right and I put it below play sound so

0:27:06.370,0:27:10.299
it's kind of neat functions are like your

0:27:08.500,0:27:12.129
ability to make your own blocks that can

0:27:10.299,0:27:13.659
do anything right so it's really kind of

0:27:12.129,0:27:15.519
neat so now when we're touching this

0:27:13.659,0:27:17.500
color we're gonna play a sound an

0:27:15.519,0:27:20.649
explosion in this case and then we're

0:27:17.500,0:27:22.840
gonna play a crash animation alright so

0:27:20.649,0:27:24.549
how do we play an animation well the way

0:27:22.840,0:27:26.710
you play in animation we've kind of seen

0:27:24.549,0:27:29.529
the starts of an animation you switch

0:27:26.710,0:27:31.269
from one costume to the next costume and

0:27:29.529,0:27:33.159
then the same way animators do it if you

0:27:31.269,0:27:35.289
make these costumes kind of like close

0:27:33.159,0:27:36.909
together it can look like movements

0:27:35.289,0:27:38.950
happening which is kind of cool so

0:27:36.909,0:27:41.169
really any animation has to start with

0:27:38.950,0:27:43.419
the costumes so we're gonna have to go

0:27:41.169,0:27:46.929
back into our racecar again so click on

0:27:43.419,0:27:49.450
the little gear and right now I've got

0:27:46.929,0:27:52.149
two costumes I've got one called car and

0:27:49.450,0:27:54.309
one called crash here's what I want to

0:27:52.149,0:27:57.490
do instead of having one costume called

0:27:54.309,0:27:59.379
crash I want to have five so we're going

0:27:57.490,0:28:03.450
to make some copies of it so I'm going

0:27:59.379,0:28:07.629
to duplicate it now I've got two crashes

0:28:03.450,0:28:11.679
duplicate three crashes four crashes and

0:28:07.629,0:28:14.409
five crashes now you'll notice that when

0:28:11.679,0:28:16.870
you do this it picks names for you it

0:28:14.409,0:28:19.929
picked you know just crash and then

0:28:16.870,0:28:22.690
crash 1 crash 2 crash well crash 11

0:28:19.929,0:28:27.549
clash 111 not the best names I'm going

0:28:22.690,0:28:32.129
to change these names to be crash one

0:28:27.549,0:28:35.860
two three four and five oh and it's

0:28:32.129,0:28:37.929
drawing a oopsie it apparently put a

0:28:35.860,0:28:39.100
little text on there to number them I

0:28:37.929,0:28:41.250
didn't really mean to number them 

0:28:39.100,0:28:44.139
all right so I want their names to be

0:28:41.250,0:28:46.299
one two three four five now I started

0:28:44.139,0:28:50.049
from the bottom to move up

0:28:46.299,0:28:51.789
I see I'm I'm currently drawing text

0:28:50.049,0:28:53.309
boxes because I've got that selected all

0:28:51.789,0:28:57.759
right I just wanted to change the names

0:28:53.309,0:28:59.470
silly computer even as you get older you

0:28:57.759,0:29:02.429
still talk to your computers quite a bit

0:28:59.470,0:29:06.970
right and so my goal is to make

0:29:02.429,0:29:11.769
eventually five copies and I want to

0:29:06.970,0:29:15.039
name them crash 1 crash 2 crash 3 crash 4

0:29:11.769,0:29:17.110
and crash 5 whoo that was harder than

0:29:15.039,0:29:19.600
I would have expected all right

0:29:17.110,0:29:22.240
so for each crash what I'm gonna do is

0:29:19.600,0:29:23.590
I'm gonna add smoke right so I'm gonna

0:29:22.240,0:29:25.600
zoom to where I can see the whole thing

0:29:23.590,0:29:27.669
because I always have to do that and I'm

0:29:25.600,0:29:30.389
gonna have some smoke coming out of my

0:29:27.669,0:29:33.879
car the first one is gonna have no smoke

0:29:30.389,0:29:35.409
the second one is gonna have small

0:29:33.879,0:29:37.570
smoke that's kind of like near the car

0:29:35.409,0:29:40.029
and then each one the smokes gonna get

0:29:37.570,0:29:43.059
bigger and farther away to draw my smoke

0:29:40.029,0:29:47.049
I'm going to draw circles I'm gonna use

0:29:43.059,0:29:49.120
some like dark gray color and I'm not an

0:29:47.049,0:29:52.299
amazing animator so I'm just gonna make

0:29:49.120,0:29:53.980
like a few circles so I'll just kind of

0:29:52.299,0:29:56.940
like make a couple circles that are kind

0:29:53.980,0:30:00.909
of like near the car to start with right

0:29:56.940,0:30:04.960
so that is the beginnings of my smoke

0:30:00.909,0:30:06.700
animation that's my crash 2 scene and by

0:30:04.960,0:30:08.440
the way you can you know you can play

0:30:06.700,0:30:11.549
these things but let's let's go and make

0:30:08.440,0:30:15.009
some more smoke so now go to the next

0:30:11.549,0:30:17.559
frame in your animation so scratch 3 or

0:30:15.009,0:30:19.389
crash 3 there's no smoke on this one

0:30:17.559,0:30:23.440
oh I do have that silly three on here that

0:30:19.389,0:30:25.570
was an accident don't do that I'll get rid of that so here's

0:30:23.440,0:30:28.389
what I want to do on frame 3 I want to

0:30:25.570,0:30:30.700
know like where were my smokes in the

0:30:28.389,0:30:32.590
last frame right and draw them a little

0:30:30.700,0:30:34.929
bigger a little higher now here's where

0:30:32.590,0:30:37.360
Tynker has a nice tool for you this tool

0:30:34.929,0:30:40.590
right up here if you click on this tool

0:30:37.360,0:30:43.929
what it'll do is it'll show you a ghost

0:30:40.590,0:30:45.970
of your previous frame so see how

0:30:43.929,0:30:48.220
whenever I click it I get a little ghost

0:30:45.970,0:30:51.190
of those old bubbles that kind of shows

0:30:48.220,0:30:52.870
me where was the last frame and that's

0:30:51.190,0:30:54.460
actually really helpful for animation

0:30:52.870,0:30:56.860
because now I want to draw them a little

0:30:54.460,0:30:58.720
bigger and a little higher right and

0:30:56.860,0:31:03.010
then you're going to keep doing this

0:30:58.720,0:31:07.990
process so there I've drawn my crash

0:31:03.010,0:31:11.370
three and now I switched to crash four now in

0:31:07.990,0:31:14.980
crash four it shows me a little ghost

0:31:11.370,0:31:16.299
and the the lady who made the virtual

0:31:14.980,0:31:17.470
pets talked about this quite a bit but

0:31:16.299,0:31:19.299
she's like you know that's how a real

0:31:17.470,0:31:22.570
animators work too right so they use

0:31:19.299,0:31:24.580
ghost to the previous frame and then

0:31:22.570,0:31:28.120
they can make them continue to get

0:31:24.580,0:31:31.809
bigger and then for my final frame there

0:31:28.120,0:31:33.190
they're gigantic right and what you can

0:31:31.809,0:31:35.260
do which is kind of fun is you can hit

0:31:33.190,0:31:38.470
this play button and then kind of see

0:31:35.260,0:31:40.419
what your animation looks like right now

0:31:38.470,0:31:42.940
we're doing a relatively simple

0:31:40.419,0:31:45.370
animation I'm just doing some smoke

0:31:42.940,0:31:47.590
circles that come off but you can do a

0:31:45.370,0:31:49.750
lot of creative things with animation

0:31:47.590,0:31:51.970
this is where like coding and art really

0:31:49.750,0:31:54.940
come together nicely you can make I mean

0:31:51.970,0:31:56.950
a hundred page animation flipbook with

0:31:54.940,0:31:58.779
with just a you know a little bit of

0:31:56.950,0:32:00.640
code and a lot of drawing if you'd like

0:31:58.779,0:32:02.980
to do that so you could spend all your

0:32:00.640,0:32:03.940
time practicing your art skills when

0:32:02.980,0:32:06.940
you're doing coding which i think is

0:32:03.940,0:32:10.510
really fun all right as soon as you've

0:32:06.940,0:32:13.899
got your crash 1 crash 2 crash 3 crash 4

0:32:10.510,0:32:16.480
and crunch 5 all set we're ready to go

0:32:13.899,0:32:18.880
write some code to actually bring your

0:32:16.480,0:32:24.460
animation to life in code so let's go

0:32:18.880,0:32:26.470
back to our code and inside of our play

0:32:24.460,0:32:33.549
crash animation we want to put a forever

0:32:26.470,0:32:36.669
loop so inside of our forever loop so

0:32:33.549,0:32:40.179
forever what we want to do is we want to

0:32:36.669,0:32:43.390
switch costumes and then wait a little

0:32:40.179,0:32:45.820
bit so let's go look at let's go

0:32:43.390,0:32:48.520
look at our commands in looks and see

0:32:45.820,0:32:50.350
if we could figure out how to do this so

0:32:48.520,0:32:52.480
one thing we could do we'll just kind of

0:32:50.350,0:32:55.690
talk about them is we could put in a next

0:32:52.480,0:32:57.370
costume and below that we could put a

0:32:55.690,0:32:58.779
time delay and that would almost work

0:32:57.370,0:33:00.730
except for our smoke would get bigger

0:32:58.779,0:33:03.159
bigger and bigger and then our car would

0:33:00.730,0:33:04.419
be cured and then our car would be

0:33:03.159,0:33:06.250
crashed and the smoke would come out

0:33:04.419,0:33:08.260
again but there would be that one frame

0:33:06.250,0:33:10.240
in there that I don't like if I used if

0:33:08.260,0:33:11.980
I just use next costume and went through

0:33:10.240,0:33:14.169
all of them there'd be that one glitch

0:33:11.980,0:33:16.000
that I don't like another thing I could

0:33:14.169,0:33:18.130
do is I could just say switch to costume

0:33:16.000,0:33:20.559
and I could just put in each one

0:33:18.130,0:33:22.210
individually and so I just have like the

0:33:20.559,0:33:25.240
first thing iss I switch to crash 1 I

0:33:22.210,0:33:27.190
wait switch crash 2 wait switch crash 3

0:33:25.240,0:33:30.640
wait and that would work it's just

0:33:27.190,0:33:34.030
tedious here's the one I want next

0:33:30.640,0:33:37.419
costume starting with so that's the

0:33:34.030,0:33:39.520
command that I actually want and I want

0:33:37.419,0:33:40.780
to start with and if you click in here

0:33:39.520,0:33:42.010
it will kind of show you your different

0:33:40.780,0:33:43.390
costumes that's nice because I'm going

0:33:42.010,0:33:47.890
to click on crash 1 but then I'm going

0:33:43.390,0:33:49.000
to take off the 1 alright and so what

0:33:47.890,0:33:52.240
it's going to do is it's going to switch

0:33:49.000,0:33:55.390
to the next costume that starts with the

0:33:52.240,0:33:57.280
word crash and so that way it won't

0:33:55.390,0:34:00.250
include our car frame in our animation

0:33:57.280,0:34:02.890
it'll just do the crash ones and you do

0:34:00.250,0:34:11.080
need a small delay between them so you

0:34:02.890,0:34:13.060
can grab a wait and you can decide how

0:34:11.080,0:34:15.669
long you want between your your

0:34:13.060,0:34:18.070
animations right so let's say that I

0:34:15.669,0:34:19.599
want point 3 seconds I don't know what's

0:34:18.070,0:34:21.010
going to look good you just have to play

0:34:19.599,0:34:27.159
with it until you figure up what looks

0:34:21.010,0:34:28.480
good and so now I'm ready to have try

0:34:27.159,0:34:31.119
my animation right so our first ever

0:34:28.480,0:34:33.369
animation together looks like my car has

0:34:31.119,0:34:35.530
disappeared so every so often there are

0:34:33.369,0:34:37.119
bugs in life and whenever you get like

0:34:35.530,0:34:40.899
weird bugs like that like my car just

0:34:37.119,0:34:42.220
disappeared where'd my car go um I'm not

0:34:40.899,0:34:45.339
quite sure what's going on there I'm

0:34:42.220,0:34:47.470
just gonna refresh the page I saved it

0:34:45.339,0:34:49.119
first should have pointed that out big

0:34:47.470,0:34:51.879
bold letters I saved it first hey

0:34:49.119,0:34:54.639
there my car's back should things like

0:34:51.879,0:34:57.119
that happen no do things like that

0:34:54.639,0:34:59.500
sometimes happen uh yeah apparently so

0:34:57.119,0:35:01.300
and your goal is just to get better with

0:34:59.500,0:35:02.619
your tools until you figure out how to

0:35:01.300,0:35:06.760
do it all right so my game is playing

0:35:02.619,0:35:13.740
just fine and now if I come around for

0:35:06.760,0:35:17.200
my big crash boom and my animation fun

0:35:13.740,0:35:18.490
and that animation is

0:35:17.200,0:35:20.020
like with the car no matter where it's

0:35:18.490,0:35:21.339
at so I kind of get this smoke that's

0:35:20.020,0:35:25.410
coming out so I'm sitting there and just

0:35:21.339,0:35:28.480
kind of like smoking I consider this a 

0:35:25.410,0:35:30.339
finished game so there's all kinds of

0:35:28.480,0:35:31.450
enhancements that we can make so I'm

0:35:30.339,0:35:33.339
going to tell you about some of those

0:35:31.450,0:35:34.750
and then I'm going to go around and I'm

0:35:33.339,0:35:36.520
going to check to see how my campers did

0:35:34.750,0:35:39.579
I'll tell you what to give them just a

0:35:36.520,0:35:41.020
second to to finish theirs up I'm going

0:35:39.579,0:35:44.230
to show you some some possible

0:35:41.020,0:35:45.790
enhancements so there are some crazy

0:35:44.230,0:35:48.940
enhancements you could do to this one

0:35:45.790,0:35:51.070
one enhancement you could do is to make

0:35:48.940,0:35:52.839
a second car now you might think oh

0:35:51.070,0:35:53.920
that's gonna be a lot of trouble you

0:35:52.839,0:35:55.839
know there's no way I'm gonna take the

0:35:53.920,0:35:57.040
time to make a second car it turns out

0:35:55.839,0:35:57.820
that making a second car is actually

0:35:57.040,0:36:01.420
easier than you think

0:35:57.820,0:36:02.980
you just duplicate this car and then you

0:36:01.420,0:36:05.050
go into this other car and you change

0:36:02.980,0:36:07.630
his color like let's say I wanted him

0:36:05.050,0:36:09.760
to be blue you just have to change his

0:36:07.630,0:36:12.190
color in all your different all your

0:36:09.760,0:36:13.750
different you know versions that you've

0:36:12.190,0:36:16.089
got of your animation so I guess that's

0:36:13.750,0:36:17.470
the hard part right so I could go

0:36:16.089,0:36:19.480
through and I could I could change the

0:36:17.470,0:36:22.630
rest of them and then you change what

0:36:19.480,0:36:28.030
keys he moves on a popular set of keys

0:36:22.630,0:36:31.089
to do is WASD is kind of like your other

0:36:28.030,0:36:33.000
arrow keys and you can see that with

0:36:31.089,0:36:36.130
like just like a couple lines of code

0:36:33.000,0:36:38.380
now I can move one car with one set of

0:36:36.130,0:36:40.089
arrow keys and then the other car with

0:36:38.380,0:36:42.010
the other set of arrow keys uh actually

0:36:40.089,0:36:43.660
it didn't made my red car do that but

0:36:42.010,0:36:47.109
you can see that you can make a

0:36:43.660,0:36:50.430
two-player game pretty easily I'm gonna

0:36:47.109,0:36:52.599
undo that before I ship this but that's okay

0:36:50.430,0:36:54.280
other things you could do if you wanted

0:36:52.599,0:36:56.980
in addition to making a two-player game

0:36:54.280,0:37:01.810
you could use like speed boost so here

0:36:56.980,0:37:04.089
like my red is a slowdown and my green

0:37:01.810,0:37:06.069
is a speed-up I've also got oil slicks

0:37:04.089,0:37:08.020
that if you hit an oil slick it kind of

0:37:06.069,0:37:10.089
wipes you out so that is something that you

0:37:08.020,0:37:13.089
could add if you wanted you could also

0:37:10.089,0:37:15.099
add things like winning right so some

0:37:13.089,0:37:17.200
people don't like to make a game unless

0:37:15.099,0:37:20.230
they can win it but if you make some

0:37:17.200,0:37:22.359
color that's like a finish line you

0:37:20.230,0:37:24.160
could win your game too right so there's

0:37:22.359,0:37:26.530
a lot of neat enhancements you can make

0:37:24.160,0:37:28.280
I'm not going to go into these I was

0:37:26.530,0:37:31.090
just kind of telling you some things

0:37:28.280,0:37:33.980
you could do if you if you wanted right

0:37:31.090,0:37:36.110
and so yeah those are some some things

0:37:33.980,0:37:39.380
that you could do alright so I think

0:37:36.110,0:37:42.380
it's time to I'll tell you what before I ship my

0:37:39.380,0:37:43.610
game I'm going to delete my race car one

0:37:42.380,0:37:45.290

0:37:43.610,0:37:50.320
