0:00:04.339,0:00:10.170
welcome back this is an optional little

0:00:07.500,0:00:12.719
extra for day one where we're learning

0:00:10.170,0:00:14.700
about variables obviously don't have to

0:00:12.719,0:00:17.160
do this one but it's just a little extra

0:00:14.700,0:00:19.740
thing if you'd like I'm gonna start off

0:00:17.160,0:00:22.140
by showing you a solution just because

0:00:19.740,0:00:24.779
it's fun to look at the solution this is a

0:00:22.140,0:00:26.849
scorekeeper for two-player games

0:00:24.779,0:00:28.500
you can see it's called score keeper but the

0:00:26.849,0:00:30.300
idea is if you're playing a game like

0:00:28.500,0:00:33.390
I don't know rock scissors paper

0:00:30.300,0:00:34.739
right then you can keep score with this

0:00:33.390,0:00:35.820
game and it kind of adds a little bit of

0:00:34.739,0:00:39.450
fun to it so let's say I'm playing

0:00:35.820,0:00:40.739
against Bowen right so if I win so you

0:00:39.450,0:00:44.430
know I throw rock you throw scissors

0:00:40.739,0:00:46.500
then I hit the letter D and D you can

0:00:44.430,0:00:50.100
see of course increased the score for

0:00:46.500,0:00:52.980
dad and then if Bowen wins a round he gets a

0:00:50.100,0:00:56.010
point and in this game its first one to three is

0:00:52.980,0:00:58.199
the winner so if I get a Bowen and then a Bowen

0:00:56.010,0:01:01.020
then it pops up a screen that says

0:00:58.199,0:01:02.879
Bowen wins right you can also add audio

0:01:01.020,0:01:06.240
which is kind of fun where you say

0:01:02.879,0:01:09.540
like Bowen wins or something like that if

0:01:06.240,0:01:11.460
you'd like so that's our goal so

0:01:09.540,0:01:13.860
let's go ahead and I'm playing with the

0:01:11.460,0:01:16.710
solution here but let's go ahead and do

0:01:13.860,0:01:18.900
this thing from scratch its goal is to

0:01:16.710,0:01:22.259
teach you about variables and to have a

0:01:18.900,0:01:24.659
little fun along the away so let's go ahead

0:01:22.259,0:01:27.210
and go into projects create a new

0:01:24.659,0:01:31.259
project and a blank project just like

0:01:27.210,0:01:33.720
we did for the monster feast and then

0:01:31.259,0:01:36.750
inside of here interestingly enough this

0:01:33.720,0:01:37.770
game has no actors so I'm going to

0:01:36.750,0:01:40.619
delete it

0:01:37.770,0:01:42.420
I guess the watchers are actors but I

0:01:40.619,0:01:45.270
didn't even really need the actors

0:01:42.420,0:01:47.700
I do need a background just because I

0:01:45.270,0:01:50.820
like backgrounds but to be honest you

0:01:47.700,0:01:54.090
can use any background you want I think

0:01:50.820,0:01:56.939
that in my example I used an old pong

0:01:54.090,0:01:58.200
background screen I can't remember where

0:01:56.939,0:02:01.560
I found that so I'll just do a search

0:01:58.200,0:02:04.740
for for pong and that's what I use there

0:02:01.560,0:02:06.899
use anything you like and then the main

0:02:04.740,0:02:09.599
thing about this game is variables so

0:02:06.899,0:02:11.700
I'm going to create two variables and so

0:02:09.599,0:02:13.010
I was playing against my son and so I

0:02:11.700,0:02:16.040
just called one

0:02:13.010,0:02:18.220
variable dad and I'm pretty sure that I

0:02:16.040,0:02:20.420
want this variable to go back to zero

0:02:18.220,0:02:23.180
whenever there's a reset so I'm just

0:02:20.420,0:02:25.159
gonna say reset variable on stop to zero I

0:02:23.180,0:02:27.950
don't normally use that reset variable

0:02:25.159,0:02:30.200
I usually set it manually but

0:02:27.950,0:02:32.299
there was really no reason not to reset

0:02:30.200,0:02:34.250
it to zero in this case it's also

0:02:32.299,0:02:38.629
interesting that since I have no actors

0:02:34.250,0:02:41.450
I'll play against Keegan in this example another one of

0:02:38.629,0:02:43.519
my sons it's interesting that since you

0:02:41.450,0:02:45.260
have no actors it doesn't ask you if you

0:02:43.519,0:02:47.690
wanted it to be a global variable or local

0:02:45.260,0:02:50.720
because the only option is a global

0:02:47.690,0:02:53.540
variable right and then I want to go

0:02:50.720,0:02:56.660
ahead and add a watcher for dad and for

0:02:53.540,0:03:00.319
Keegan by the way these Watchers they

0:02:56.660,0:03:02.359
can be any any size you want like you

0:03:00.319,0:03:04.670
just type in here with the word for the

0:03:02.359,0:03:06.530
substring if you've got a long name so

0:03:04.670,0:03:09.470
if I play right now you can see it says

0:03:06.530,0:03:14.150
dad zero and it says Keegan

0:03:09.470,0:03:15.590
apparently missing that's annoying oh man

0:03:14.150,0:03:19.639
they have so many bugs in these

0:03:15.590,0:03:23.510
Watchers so when I run it I don't know if you can see

0:03:19.639,0:03:28.430
this it says dad zero but it says Kega :

0:03:23.510,0:03:30.109
that and so you do have to sometimes go

0:03:28.430,0:03:33.079
in and modify the code that's in these

0:03:30.109,0:03:36.049
Watchers right and so if I look at this I

0:03:33.079,0:03:43.220
can see it says sub string of Keegan

0:03:36.049,0:03:45.590
from 1 to 6 it must be not be

0:03:43.220,0:03:47.180
so I guess I want 1 to 7 so it must not

0:03:45.590,0:03:49.549
include the last thing because I want it to 

0:03:47.180,0:03:52.010
actually say Keegon's name and it says

0:03:49.549,0:03:55.609
property Keegan Oh dad watcher well

0:03:52.010,0:03:58.639
that's insane I want to it to be any

0:03:55.609,0:04:01.250
so Dad watcher worked fine oh it said stage you

0:03:58.639,0:04:02.660
should be able to say any as well so

0:04:01.250,0:04:05.660
let's go ahead and run that and see if that

0:04:02.660,0:04:07.280
works better so now it says dad zero 

0:04:05.660,0:04:10.099
Keegan zero 

0:04:07.280,0:04:12.829
I don't know why there are so many bugs

0:04:10.099,0:04:14.690
the inside the auto generated

0:04:12.829,0:04:16.760
code for the Watchers

0:04:14.690,0:04:18.199
by the way other things you can do with

0:04:16.760,0:04:21.500
watchers that you can change like the

0:04:18.199,0:04:22.880
font size so if you change it to 48 you

0:04:21.500,0:04:25.669
do that and it just kinda looks a little

0:04:22.880,0:04:26.030
bigger you can of course also just make

0:04:25.669,0:04:29.780
the box

0:04:26.030,0:04:34.160
itself bigger so if I wanted to I could make

0:04:29.780,0:04:37.520
them both 48 and I can make his box a

0:04:34.160,0:04:40.070
little bigger so he fits and then now if I

0:04:37.520,0:04:41.570
run it you can see that it says dad zero and

0:04:40.070,0:04:44.840
Keegan still needs to be just a little

0:04:41.570,0:04:48.860
wider so I'll tell you waht I'll go ahead and drag him out

0:04:44.840,0:04:51.550
just a little wider cool so now if I

0:04:48.860,0:04:54.410
run it it looks like Keegan keeps on growing

0:04:51.550,0:04:57.110
maybe I shouldn't have messed with it so

0:04:54.410,0:05:01.160
48 was just a bit much maybe I'll go with 24

0:04:57.110,0:05:02.960
and 24 it's interesting that because

0:05:01.160,0:05:05.630
their aspect ratios are different one

0:05:02.960,0:05:09.140
of them worked fine and then the other had a little bit

0:05:05.630,0:05:11.780
of an issue getting there so let's go ahead and make 

0:05:09.140,0:05:13.460
them both kind of big but you can play

0:05:11.780,0:05:16.430
around with them until it's easier

0:05:13.460,0:05:18.530
for you to see cool then this is a

0:05:16.430,0:05:22.220
simple little game so there's no other

0:05:18.530,0:05:24.050
actors those actors are doing their

0:05:22.220,0:05:26.180
thing with the auto-generated code just

0:05:24.050,0:05:28.610
fine and the code that I'm gonna add is

0:05:26.180,0:05:30.470
actually gonna go on the stage and

0:05:28.610,0:05:33.050
that's because we don't have other

0:05:30.470,0:05:34.010
actors right codes gotta go somewhere oh by

0:05:33.050,0:05:40.460
the way this is gonna be called

0:05:34.010,0:05:42.410
scorekeeper so scorekeeper I'll go

0:05:40.460,0:05:44.780
ahead and save it I'll publish it to the

0:05:42.410,0:05:47.539
community later I'll just go ahead and say scorekeeper

0:05:44.780,0:05:49.729
for now alright so let's go ahead and add some code 

0:05:47.539,0:05:51.860
so what I want to do is I want to have

0:05:49.729,0:05:55.880
some things happen when you press

0:05:51.860,0:05:58.000
certain buttons so right now I'm going

0:05:55.880,0:06:00.650
to drag over this with up arrow pressed

0:05:58.000,0:06:02.990
but I'm going to switch it to D for dad

0:06:00.650,0:06:06.020
and then I'm gonna also have some code

0:06:02.990,0:06:08.810
that happens when Keegan scores so

0:06:06.020,0:06:13.700
I'm gonna put him on k you can use

0:06:08.810,0:06:15.950
any keyboard key you'd like of

0:06:13.700,0:06:18.729
course and what I want to have happen

0:06:15.950,0:06:22.669
whenever that occurs is I just want to

0:06:18.729,0:06:25.400
change the appropriate variables so I'm going to

0:06:22.669,0:06:29.210
change dad by one or I'm going to

0:06:25.400,0:06:31.820
change Keegan by one and so now the only

0:06:29.210,0:06:33.710
thing I want to do is also I can run it

0:06:31.820,0:06:35.630
right now and I should see that works so

0:06:33.710,0:06:40.130
if I hit D dad goes up

0:06:35.630,0:06:42.560
if I hit k Keegan goes up right so it's a

0:06:40.130,0:06:43.970
scorekeeper if I hit stop and play again

0:06:42.560,0:06:46.700
it resets them to zero that's because

0:06:43.970,0:06:48.560
we set their defaults if you click on here

0:06:46.700,0:06:49.750
they have a default of 0 which is kind of neat 

0:06:48.560,0:06:51.680
right

0:06:49.750,0:06:53.720
alright now the other thing I want to do

0:06:51.680,0:06:56.480
is I want to always watch for game over

0:06:53.720,0:07:02.300
so I'm gonna have something that is

0:06:56.480,0:07:04.040
forever so on start forever check for

0:07:02.300,0:07:08.690
things right so I'm going to check to

0:07:04.040,0:07:10.130
see if dad hits the max score and if so I'm

0:07:08.690,0:07:14.330
going to present something that says dad

0:07:10.130,0:07:18.590
wins or if Keegan does right so let's

0:07:14.330,0:07:20.570
go ahead and say operators probably down

0:07:18.590,0:07:27.740
towards the bottom of the logical things

0:07:20.570,0:07:28.940
oh here's equals so if dad equals and

0:07:27.740,0:07:30.290
you can decide what you want your game to

0:07:28.940,0:07:32.960
go to I'm gonna make it be five

0:07:30.290,0:07:35.600
so I did three in my other another example

0:07:32.960,0:07:38.630
and I'll do five here and if that does

0:07:35.600,0:07:43.720
happen I want to somehow say that dad

0:07:38.630,0:07:50.600
won so maybe I'll say for two seconds

0:07:43.720,0:07:53.630
dad wins and right now it's gonna do a

0:07:50.600,0:07:55.630
bottom messagebox and that might be good

0:07:53.630,0:07:58.130
enough right so now if I start it up

0:07:55.630,0:08:00.980
and switch my stage just so you can see it

0:07:58.130,0:08:04.820
better if I hit (press) d d d d d it

0:08:00.980,0:08:07.550
says dad wins down at the bottom there so I consider

0:08:04.820,0:08:09.830
that successful the game does keep on

0:08:07.550,0:08:11.660
playing though which I don't like I kind

0:08:09.830,0:08:14.240
of want it to be done so Keegan could

0:08:11.660,0:08:16.070
actually get up to five as well so now

0:08:14.240,0:08:18.020
it's just like battling do I say dad wins

0:08:16.070,0:08:22.460
or Keegan wins right so I did want to

0:08:18.020,0:08:24.890
actually stop the game as well by the

0:08:22.460,0:08:27.620
way you can also change how things look

0:08:24.890,0:08:30.320
so you can make it be like a center

0:08:27.620,0:08:31.940
message box if you'd rather do that Oh

0:08:30.320,0:08:33.440
Keegan is not allowed to win yet

0:08:31.940,0:08:35.719
that's why it didn't say Keegan wins and

0:08:33.440,0:08:39.260
then if that does happen I do want to

0:08:35.719,0:08:41.270
stop the game so now I can go ahead and

0:08:39.260,0:08:44.270
test it again so if I say (press) d d d

0:08:41.270,0:08:47.780
d d it says dad wins in kind of this

0:08:44.270,0:08:48.750
not so pretty box now I could duplicate

0:08:47.780,0:08:50.550
this code so I could

0:08:48.750,0:08:54.089
click here and duplicate it but I actually

0:08:50.550,0:08:56.689
want to improve it some before I duplicate it

0:08:54.089,0:08:59.040
and what I'd like to do is I'd like to

0:08:56.689,0:09:01.259
make it more fun right

0:08:59.040,0:09:03.509
and so instead of just saying dad wins

0:09:01.259,0:09:06.439
which is perfectly functional I want to

0:09:03.509,0:09:10.230
like switch to a backdrop that I make

0:09:06.439,0:09:12.120
for my win and I want Keegan to switch to a 

0:09:10.230,0:09:13.410
backdrop that he makes for his win so

0:09:12.120,0:09:15.449
here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go to

0:09:13.410,0:09:18.509
the stage I'm gonna click on this gear

0:09:15.449,0:09:21.509
I'm gonna say add backdrop so now I'm

0:09:18.509,0:09:25.500
gonna make some backdrop just whatever I

0:09:21.509,0:09:28.649
want for dad wins so you get to pick what

0:09:25.500,0:09:31.050
backdrop you want and then we're gonna

0:09:28.649,0:09:34.410
actually go in and edit it right so I'm

0:09:31.050,0:09:36.629
gonna edit on the stage here so this

0:09:34.410,0:09:42.899
farm landscape this is gonna be the dad

0:09:36.629,0:09:45.779
win screen and this opened up the

0:09:42.899,0:09:47.970
editor which is kind of fun and you can

0:09:45.779,0:09:50.519
do whatever you like with the editor so

0:09:47.970,0:09:53.879
maybe I'll put a jumbo font maybe like a

0:09:50.519,0:09:58.350
hundred size of a hundred opacity and

0:09:53.879,0:10:02.399
I'll say in the font of my choice dad

0:09:58.350,0:10:07.850
wins right oh it's about to be red I don't know

0:10:02.399,0:10:12.629
if I want red I'll go with blue and I'll say dad wins

0:10:07.850,0:10:15.569
now the thing about their editors as

0:10:12.629,0:10:17.069
soon as you like let go of the text it

0:10:15.569,0:10:18.509
does kind of become part of the

0:10:17.069,0:10:20.009
background you can't edit it as well

0:10:18.509,0:10:22.199
that is one place where scratch is a

0:10:20.009,0:10:27.410
little bit better but there's my dad

0:10:22.199,0:10:29.639
win screen and then Keegan looks like I'm

0:10:27.410,0:10:33.120
not as good with their interface I

0:10:29.639,0:10:34.709
need to add it from the other I need to say

0:10:33.120,0:10:36.209
add backdrop from the other place right

0:10:34.709,0:10:38.519
so there's dad wins

0:10:36.209,0:10:42.750
so I'm only halfway done so I've got

0:10:38.519,0:10:45.149
the stage I can see that I've got a pong

0:10:42.750,0:10:47.069
and a dad win screen I've got to make

0:10:45.149,0:10:49.470
one for Keegan how about I do it now so

0:10:47.069,0:10:51.660
I guess the way you add is you click on this gear say

0:10:49.470,0:10:54.300
add background and then we'll pick

0:10:51.660,0:10:55.270
something for Keegan Keegan is gonna

0:10:54.300,0:10:58.350
do something with

0:10:55.270,0:11:00.550
space I bet so there's lunar surfaces

0:10:58.350,0:11:05.290
oh that one looks fancy 

0:11:00.550,0:11:07.120
and so now you can edit it and you

0:11:05.290,0:11:09.100
can have it say

0:11:07.120,0:11:11.500
Keegan wins or whoever you

0:11:09.100,0:11:13.540
would like right he likes crazy fonts

0:11:11.500,0:11:21.100
what's the craziest font that I can find in

0:11:13.540,0:11:26.230
here sure that one looks good Keegan wins all

0:11:21.100,0:11:29.590
right so save then back great it's being a little sluggish

0:11:26.230,0:11:31.570
here so whenever dad wins what I

0:11:29.590,0:11:34.870
want to do is instead of

0:11:31.570,0:11:37.630
saying that I want to actually like go to

0:11:34.870,0:11:42.730
looks and I want to switch to the

0:11:37.630,0:11:44.920
background for dad wins so we're gonna

0:11:42.730,0:11:48.520
switch to background switch to 

0:11:44.920,0:11:51.280
background dad win screen hey while I'm

0:11:48.520,0:11:54.460
in here I'm going to go ahead and make

0:11:51.280,0:11:56.140
sure that it starts off the game on the

0:11:54.460,0:11:58.240
pong screen just in case it got

0:11:56.140,0:11:59.620
left a little weird and I think I can go

0:11:58.240,0:12:02.620
ahead and duplicate this code so I'm

0:11:59.620,0:12:04.480
going to go ahead and highlight it and

0:12:02.620,0:12:06.940
then do a control C control V to

0:12:04.480,0:12:08.530
duplicate it and the nice thing about

0:12:06.940,0:12:11.700
this is now I just have to change this

0:12:08.530,0:12:15.910
one for Keegon right so I pop that out

0:12:11.700,0:12:19.270
switch that to Keegan and then in variables

0:12:15.910,0:12:20.860
I pop in Keegan now I've done this

0:12:19.270,0:12:23.530
extremely fast but the nice thing about

0:12:20.860,0:12:25.600
videos is that you can pause it and you

0:12:23.530,0:12:27.610
can look at the finished code and you can

0:12:25.600,0:12:30.340
make yours look like mine there's no

0:12:27.610,0:12:32.200
goal for you to type and drag as fast as

0:12:30.340,0:12:34.500
I type and drag as long as you can see

0:12:32.200,0:12:37.360
the finished product and it makes sense

0:12:34.500,0:12:39.490
let's go and add a delay in here where

0:12:37.360,0:12:41.920
you can see the background I don't know

0:12:39.490,0:12:43.080
for at least three seconds before the

0:12:41.920,0:12:49.330
game ends

0:12:43.080,0:12:49.870
alright so now it is kind of better so dddd 

0:12:49.330,0:12:52.690
one more time

0:12:49.870,0:12:54.280
dad wins great and it stays like dad

0:12:52.690,0:12:58.260
wins until the game ends

0:12:54.280,0:13:00.610
play it again and let Keegan win kkkkk

0:12:58.260,0:13:03.420
and then it says Keegan wins somehow 

0:13:00.610,0:13:05.990
his background is

0:13:03.420,0:13:12.399
microscopically small

0:13:05.990,0:13:12.399
so Oh old trick I was zoomed way in and

0:13:12.910,0:13:20.570
didn't know it bummer

0:13:14.350,0:13:22.760
let's see here I need to fix that so I

0:13:20.570,0:13:25.250
think that this game is almost good to

0:13:22.760,0:13:28.339
go oh one more thing that I want to add

0:13:25.250,0:13:32.660
is sounds can be fun so let's just

0:13:28.339,0:13:36.350
kind of show you sounds so sounds if

0:13:32.660,0:13:39.500
I click on the gear here I can go into

0:13:36.350,0:13:41.270
sounds and I can add sounds it can

0:13:39.500,0:13:44.270
actually be really fun to record your

0:13:41.270,0:13:48.500
own sounds so if you record an audio

0:13:44.270,0:13:52.610
file what you can do is you can click on

0:13:48.500,0:13:56.360
record here and use your microphone and

0:13:52.610,0:13:58.640
you can say Daddy wins actually don't

0:13:56.360,0:14:00.350
make yours say Keegan and Daddy make them

0:13:58.640,0:14:02.510
say whatever your name is

0:14:00.350,0:14:04.760
mine's taking forever to upload hey you

0:14:02.510,0:14:06.709
know what it's supposed to work but

0:14:04.760,0:14:09.649
if it doesn't you know what life goes on

0:14:06.709,0:14:12.649
you can always pick any sound you like

0:14:09.649,0:14:14.209
right so maybe there's some cool victory

0:14:12.649,0:14:17.540
sounds in here you play around with

0:14:14.209,0:14:20.300
things I don't want to take an hour to

0:14:17.540,0:14:22.850
figure out my sounds but I'll say that

0:14:20.300,0:14:25.430
it's a fun thing to put in some

0:14:22.850,0:14:27.980
sounds just because it can make your

0:14:25.430,0:14:31.640
game more fun with sounds and you

0:14:27.980,0:14:35.089
typically use like play until done so

0:14:31.640,0:14:39.230
maybe dad would be the chicken and Keegan will 

0:14:35.089,0:14:41.839
be the pig I don't know I'm just kind of making up random

0:14:39.230,0:14:43.700
things there so there's my code that

0:14:41.839,0:14:46.880
should be the finished code hopefully

0:14:43.700,0:14:50.329
for my little scorekeeper game if D gets 

0:14:46.880,0:14:51.440
to 5 it should play the the sound which I

0:14:50.329,0:14:53.140
don't think is coming through becuase I

0:14:51.440,0:14:57.110
don't have sound set up for this video

0:14:53.140,0:15:00.800
should have I didn't and if Keegan wins

0:14:57.110,0:15:02.450
it will play his sound and that should

0:15:00.800,0:15:04.339
work for you and actually play a sound

0:15:02.450,0:15:05.779
you don't hear it on my recording here

0:15:04.339,0:15:07.339
because I'm not playing system audio I

0:15:05.779,0:15:10.579
don't think at least I can't hear it

0:15:07.339,0:15:13.130
alright that is the little follow

0:15:10.579,0:15:16.070
along for the score keeper if you want to

0:15:13.130,0:15:18.680
you can do is save and publish so this

0:15:16.070,0:15:25.420
is an example so this is an extra

0:15:18.680,0:15:30.110
example for day one of week one

0:15:25.420,0:15:35.660
connecting with code 2020 so I'll click save and publish

0:15:30.110,0:15:37.310
there and that looks good alright we'll see you next time

0:15:35.660,0:15:39.170
for day two we'll try to make an

0:15:37.310,0:15:41.150
advanced version that's just kind of

0:15:39.170,0:15:43.520
like this and then also a family version

0:15:41.150,0:15:44.660
which is kind of more fun alright see

0:15:43.520,0:15:48.179
you then bye

0:15:44.660,0:15:48.179
