0:00:04.670,0:00:09.090
hey kids I'm Dave Fisher from

0:00:07.109,0:00:11.580
rose-hulman welcome to day one of the

0:00:09.090,0:00:13.440
connecting with code camp I want to

0:00:11.580,0:00:16.020
start off today by introducing some of

0:00:13.440,0:00:17.039
the campers that I have with me and what

0:00:16.020,0:00:20.010
I'm going to do is I'm going to switch

0:00:17.039,0:00:21.420
to instead of that camera a daddy cam so

0:00:20.010,0:00:23.250
you can meet some of our campers

0:00:21.420,0:00:26.220
I'll tell actually we'll do them in

0:00:23.250,0:00:28.109
birth order so our first first person we

0:00:26.220,0:00:30.900
have over here is Neela Neela how old

0:00:28.109,0:00:32.309
are you yeah she's four she's a little

0:00:30.900,0:00:34.110
too young for the kid so she's going to

0:00:32.309,0:00:37.260
play on her iPad now to be just fine and

0:00:34.110,0:01:09.180
dandy our next up and the order is

0:00:37.260,0:01:11.630
introduce yourself normally a preschool

0:01:09.180,0:01:13.950
teacher but you can do this

0:01:11.630,0:01:15.720
the next up is kind of have another

0:01:13.950,0:01:18.979
person that's great for a target

0:01:15.720,0:01:18.979
audience we're gonna introduce yourself

0:01:21.799,0:01:25.860
and Keegan who is a perfect gauge for

0:01:24.420,0:01:27.180
this he's done a little bit of coding

0:01:25.860,0:01:30.210
he's wearing one of our camp t-shirts

0:01:27.180,0:01:34.619
from another year he went to the 2018

0:01:30.210,0:01:36.930
Boeing for one - he's wearing 2019 and

0:01:34.619,0:01:39.450
then our fourth and final camper and one

0:01:36.930,0:01:42.259
introduce yourself hi I'm Emily Fisher

0:01:39.450,0:01:45.360
I'm 10 years old I'm in fourth grade

0:01:42.259,0:01:47.220
fourth grade and so McKinley has done

0:01:45.360,0:01:48.960
quite a bit of coding so for her some of

0:01:47.220,0:01:51.659
this stuff might be less than what she

0:01:48.960,0:01:54.210
needs but that's my that's my team of

0:01:51.659,0:01:56.009
campers that I've got here today so

0:01:54.210,0:01:58.000
let's go ahead and dive in to what we're

0:01:56.009,0:02:01.360
doing hopefully in another video

0:01:58.000,0:02:02.980
you learn how to log in to tinker tinker

0:02:01.360,0:02:05.850
has a lot of things that you can do by

0:02:02.980,0:02:08.080
yourself that's great I do those things

0:02:05.850,0:02:09.130
but well we're going to focus on is

0:02:08.080,0:02:11.380
things that we're going to do together

0:02:09.130,0:02:14.560
called projects so goodness look right

0:02:11.380,0:02:15.670
here where it says my projects and what

0:02:14.560,0:02:17.740
we're going to do is we're going to make

0:02:15.670,0:02:21.310
our first project and so you go and

0:02:17.740,0:02:23.110
click on create new project and then

0:02:21.310,0:02:24.430
from here like depending on what tab you

0:02:23.110,0:02:26.950
got selected you can see that there's a

0:02:24.430,0:02:28.990
ton of different types of projects we're

0:02:26.950,0:02:31.120
doing what's called block coding right

0:02:28.990,0:02:34.540
and we're going to start from scratch so

0:02:31.120,0:02:36.130
we want a blank block coding project so

0:02:34.540,0:02:38.709
go ahead and click on a blank block

0:02:36.130,0:02:41.140
coding project so I'm going to start off

0:02:38.709,0:02:43.390
by getting you more familiar with the

0:02:41.140,0:02:45.580
tinkerer interface if you happen to know

0:02:43.390,0:02:47.110
the scratch interface it's almost

0:02:45.580,0:02:48.640
identical right so we're just using

0:02:47.110,0:02:51.010
features so you don't have to log into

0:02:48.640,0:02:52.180
one place but what we're going to do is

0:02:51.010,0:02:54.459
we're going to do something with this

0:02:52.180,0:02:55.959
monster just because I always like to

0:02:54.459,0:02:57.160
click buttons I go ahead and click the

0:02:55.959,0:02:58.989
play button and just kind of see what

0:02:57.160,0:03:01.180
happens and you'll notice that they've

0:02:58.989,0:03:03.580
given you some code already odd that

0:03:01.180,0:03:04.930
makes monster walk back and forth now

0:03:03.580,0:03:06.250
sometimes I want my screen a little

0:03:04.930,0:03:09.280
bigger I can grab this little button

0:03:06.250,0:03:11.950
here and make the screen bigger so this

0:03:09.280,0:03:14.230
monster is kind of exciting but after a

0:03:11.950,0:03:15.370
while you will get bored watching them

0:03:14.230,0:03:17.400
go back and forth let's see how long you

0:03:15.370,0:03:19.390
can watch him before you get bored and

0:03:17.400,0:03:20.470
what we're going to do today I'm just

0:03:19.390,0:03:22.570
going to show you a finished example

0:03:20.470,0:03:24.790
real quick so just watch him for a

0:03:22.570,0:03:25.720
minute this is a finished example what

0:03:24.790,0:03:27.610
we're going to do is we're gonna make

0:03:25.720,0:03:29.290
this monster do different things and

0:03:27.610,0:03:30.910
what we're gonna make this monster do is

0:03:29.290,0:03:32.470
we're gonna make the monster chase your

0:03:30.910,0:03:35.320
mouse around right so wherever your

0:03:32.470,0:03:37.329
computer mouse goes he'll follow it now

0:03:35.320,0:03:38.950
you can work follow along on an iPad if

0:03:37.329,0:03:40.630
you want but it's gonna be hard to use a

0:03:38.950,0:03:42.880
mouse on an iPad so you have to like

0:03:40.630,0:03:45.280
adjust that and his goal is to eat

0:03:42.880,0:03:47.530
cupcakes right and every time he eats a

0:03:45.280,0:03:48.549
cupcake a couple things happen one thing

0:03:47.530,0:03:50.220
that's gonna happen is you'll notice

0:03:48.549,0:03:52.450
that there's this variable called food

0:03:50.220,0:03:53.799
that's a three right now and as soon as

0:03:52.450,0:03:55.239
I get that cupcake it's gonna go down to

0:03:53.799,0:03:57.549
two so we're gonna learn about variables

0:03:55.239,0:04:00.790
and then if you collect all the cupcakes

0:03:57.549,0:04:02.560
it's gonna say you win so that's the

0:04:00.790,0:04:04.780
goal that we're trying to make together

0:04:02.560,0:04:06.580
today and in doing this we're going to

0:04:04.780,0:04:07.300
learn about variables and all the

0:04:06.580,0:04:10.030
different things that

0:04:07.300,0:04:12.700
doing in Pinker first let's start off by

0:04:10.030,0:04:15.340
understanding what we got so what we got

0:04:12.700,0:04:16.690
is we got a stage so we have a stage

0:04:15.340,0:04:19.060
here you can click on the stage if you

0:04:16.690,0:04:20.739
want the stage is perfectly white we're

0:04:19.060,0:04:24.250
gonna obviously add a background to our

0:04:20.739,0:04:27.460
stage and then we have our actor now his

0:04:24.250,0:04:28.840
name is actor which is kind of a

0:04:27.460,0:04:30.370
terrible name it's like a human being

0:04:28.840,0:04:32.620
called human so let's go ahead and

0:04:30.370,0:04:34.000
change his name so go ahead and click in

0:04:32.620,0:04:36.640
here where it says actor and you can

0:04:34.000,0:04:39.280
actually just backspace over this and

0:04:36.640,0:04:40.540
I'm gonna call him monster but you can

0:04:39.280,0:04:43.570
call them anything you want if you want

0:04:40.540,0:04:45.790
to call your monster Fred or Bob or Dave

0:04:43.570,0:04:49.540
I'm a good monster you can do those

0:04:45.790,0:04:52.750
things if you'd like now let's look at

0:04:49.540,0:04:56.050
some more things with our monster he has

0:04:52.750,0:04:57.820
code that's available to him and let's

0:04:56.050,0:05:00.820
see if we can figure what some of this

0:04:57.820,0:05:01.630
code means so first thing it says is one

0:05:00.820,0:05:03.490
starved

0:05:01.630,0:05:05.380
so once dark is something that happens

0:05:03.490,0:05:07.420
when you hit the start button so when I

0:05:05.380,0:05:09.550
hit the start button he does a couple

0:05:07.420,0:05:11.919
things first he does something called

0:05:09.550,0:05:13.840
set his rotation style - left and right

0:05:11.919,0:05:16.000
so he doesn't like go up and down he

0:05:13.840,0:05:18.100
just does left and right and that just

0:05:16.000,0:05:20.440
has to do with his image and then he

0:05:18.100,0:05:22.480
does something forever now this is kind

0:05:20.440,0:05:24.520
of funny if I were to walk up to a human

0:05:22.480,0:05:26.890
and I would say hey pick up sticks

0:05:24.520,0:05:28.030
forever that would be kind of mean I

0:05:26.890,0:05:30.669
wouldn't do that to somebody

0:05:28.030,0:05:33.100
right but in programming you tell

0:05:30.669,0:05:36.100
programs to do things forever all the

0:05:33.100,0:05:38.169
time right going all the time and here's

0:05:36.100,0:05:40.030
what he has to do forever he has to

0:05:38.169,0:05:42.850
animate this walk so you can kind of see

0:05:40.030,0:05:46.060
how he's got this animation going on he

0:05:42.850,0:05:48.490
has to move ten pixels and he's on an

0:05:46.060,0:05:50.560
edge he has to bounce and then so that

0:05:48.490,0:05:52.570
it kind of has like a smooth look to it

0:05:50.560,0:05:54.940
his speed is controlled by how long he

0:05:52.570,0:05:57.010
waits so speed is a function of distance

0:05:54.940,0:05:58.330
he moves which is ten pixels and the

0:05:57.010,0:06:00.370
time and he things to do it so that

0:05:58.330,0:06:01.870
determines how fast he goes if you

0:06:00.370,0:06:04.030
wanted to you can make a small change to

0:06:01.870,0:06:05.800
him let's say instead of ten pixels you

0:06:04.030,0:06:09.160
wanted him to go faster let's have him

0:06:05.800,0:06:09.690
go at 30 pixels so what do you think's

0:06:09.160,0:06:12.490
gonna happen

0:06:09.690,0:06:15.110
he's gonna book it right so now he's

0:06:12.490,0:06:17.319
walking super fast back and forth

0:06:15.110,0:06:20.900
let's change something else just for fun

0:06:17.319,0:06:22.849
what if we were to take out this animate

0:06:20.900,0:06:24.470
walk what would happen here's how you

0:06:22.849,0:06:24.830
take out code and tinker this is kind of

0:06:24.470,0:06:27.349
neat

0:06:24.830,0:06:28.699
so there's handles you can kind of see

0:06:27.349,0:06:31.009
it's like this gray bar that showed up

0:06:28.699,0:06:33.199
on the left and the right if you click

0:06:31.009,0:06:35.150
on the left one it selects that code and

0:06:33.199,0:06:37.550
all the one below it and if you select

0:06:35.150,0:06:39.740
the right one is selects just that one

0:06:37.550,0:06:42.590
so kids it's a very like fine motor

0:06:39.740,0:06:44.419
skill so some adults might have to help

0:06:42.590,0:06:46.460
with this but if you were to take this

0:06:44.419,0:06:47.900
right handle and just drag it out of

0:06:46.460,0:06:50.810
your code block we'll put it back in a

0:06:47.900,0:06:52.879
minute and set it over here if you were

0:06:50.810,0:06:55.219
to run it again our program has changed

0:06:52.879,0:06:57.860
right and so now you can see he still

0:06:55.219,0:07:00.229
moves he still bounces but notice how

0:06:57.860,0:07:02.419
he's not animating his walk it's just

0:07:00.229,0:07:05.270
like gliding right so that's kind of

0:07:02.419,0:07:05.900
what code is is all about so what we're

0:07:05.270,0:07:08.960
gonna do

0:07:05.900,0:07:10.520
can you make sure we know how to run and

0:07:08.960,0:07:12.349
stop our code yeah

0:07:10.520,0:07:13.759
so in order to run and stop your code

0:07:12.349,0:07:15.800
there's a button down here in the corner

0:07:13.759,0:07:19.039
so got a question for one of my campers

0:07:15.800,0:07:22.250
at stable here so run you click this

0:07:19.039,0:07:24.219
orange play button and then there if you

0:07:22.250,0:07:26.900
want to stop I hit the red stop button

0:07:24.219,0:07:28.819
and so that's how you run your code or

0:07:26.900,0:07:30.289
not and obviously you can usually see

0:07:28.819,0:07:33.289
your code running by the stage moving

0:07:30.289,0:07:36.020
but also this green outline tells you

0:07:33.289,0:07:38.449
for sure that your code is running so

0:07:36.020,0:07:40.639
let's start doing some things we could

0:07:38.449,0:07:42.710
write this program in any order but I

0:07:40.639,0:07:45.529
think what I would like to do first just

0:07:42.710,0:07:48.110
for fun is to fix my background so right

0:07:45.529,0:07:50.539
now my monster is just on a perfectly

0:07:48.110,0:07:52.539
white background so his stage is all

0:07:50.539,0:07:55.729
white so I'm gonna see if I can fix that

0:07:52.539,0:07:59.960
so to change that you have to click on

0:07:55.729,0:08:02.330
the stage and then there's a little gear

0:07:59.960,0:08:04.639
over here so you have to click on this

0:08:02.330,0:08:07.129
little gear icon the gear icon if used a

0:08:04.639,0:08:09.710
lot in computer programs it kinda means

0:08:07.129,0:08:12.199
like settings and configuring and things

0:08:09.710,0:08:15.440
like that and you'll notice that the

0:08:12.199,0:08:19.669
stage has three tabs at the top costumes

0:08:15.440,0:08:21.379
say out and advanced so costumes and you

0:08:19.669,0:08:24.259
can see that they the stage currently

0:08:21.379,0:08:25.690
has none so we want to add one right so

0:08:24.259,0:08:30.040
find this button that says

0:08:25.690,0:08:32.860
background and now we have to decide

0:08:30.040,0:08:34.900
what background to put on now I'm gonna

0:08:32.860,0:08:37.000
put that kitchen background that you saw

0:08:34.900,0:08:38.890
on the solution but to be honest you can

0:08:37.000,0:08:40.599
use any background you want so if you

0:08:38.890,0:08:41.710
wanted to do something crazy and

0:08:40.599,0:08:45.190
different I don't mind

0:08:41.710,0:08:47.230
I'm okay with that but you will have to

0:08:45.190,0:08:50.470
pick something that you like so I'm

0:08:47.230,0:08:52.510
gonna find that kitchen scene so I think

0:08:50.470,0:08:54.940
that there's different categories here

0:08:52.510,0:08:57.370
that you can do let's see if I can find

0:08:54.940,0:08:59.200
Oh cookie that's where I probably fell

0:08:57.370,0:09:02.980
on my kitchenette sure enough here's my

0:08:59.200,0:09:05.020
kitchen now I have that that's one of my

0:09:02.980,0:09:06.400
backgrounds that's available you'll

0:09:05.020,0:09:08.680
notice that in the background here it

0:09:06.400,0:09:10.210
actually changed that background and

0:09:08.680,0:09:13.720
that's really all we want to do with

0:09:10.210,0:09:17.260
this stage so the stage could have code

0:09:13.720,0:09:19.840
but it currently has none it's empty and

0:09:17.260,0:09:23.380
it has costumes and it's in the costume

0:09:19.840,0:09:25.060
that we want now in later videos we'll

0:09:23.380,0:09:26.620
do more with the stage but right now

0:09:25.060,0:09:29.290
that's plenty that's all we really care

0:09:26.620,0:09:32.440
about now we've got our monster

0:09:29.290,0:09:33.850
so our monster has some code I kind of

0:09:32.440,0:09:38.460
mangled mine because I've taken some

0:09:33.850,0:09:38.460
things out and another question from our

0:09:41.120,0:09:48.250
[Music]

0:09:42.510,0:09:56.080
code I'm gonna help people make

0:09:48.250,0:09:59.200
difference okay so we were on stage yeah

0:09:56.080,0:10:02.490
cool so you can switch between the stage

0:09:59.200,0:10:06.520
code and the actor code that's right

0:10:02.490,0:10:08.560
cool all right so let's go ahead and do

0:10:06.520,0:10:10.780
some more things with this so the first

0:10:08.560,0:10:13.510
thing I want to do is I want him to walk

0:10:10.780,0:10:16.180
towards my mouth right so right now he's

0:10:13.510,0:10:18.880
just walking directly left and right so

0:10:16.180,0:10:21.730
let's see if we can find some code and

0:10:18.880,0:10:24.190
put it in there so we're learning about

0:10:21.730,0:10:25.420
how this code works you can see that

0:10:24.190,0:10:29.080
it's broken up into different categories

0:10:25.420,0:10:32.020
the top one is called events and then

0:10:29.080,0:10:35.200
there's things with control and a whole

0:10:32.020,0:10:37.089
bunch of things we currently care about

0:10:35.200,0:10:40.260
motion so see if you can find the

0:10:37.089,0:10:40.260
category called motion

0:10:40.709,0:10:46.089
so these are different motion commands

0:10:43.870,0:10:48.940
that we can have our or actor do our

0:10:46.089,0:10:52.720
monster and we want to find one that

0:10:48.940,0:10:55.660
says point towards mouse pointer listen

0:10:52.720,0:10:58.450
to my words point towards mouse pointer

0:10:55.660,0:11:00.940
so there's there's there's two problems

0:10:58.450,0:11:03.339
that sometimes happen so one says go to

0:11:00.940,0:11:05.740
mouse pointer we don't want that one and

0:11:03.339,0:11:10.690
then you have to scroll way down to find

0:11:05.740,0:11:11.800
this one point towards mouse pointer now

0:11:10.690,0:11:13.810
I'm going to show you what happens if

0:11:11.800,0:11:16.330
you grab the wrong one but but I'm going

0:11:13.810,0:11:19.390
to add this to my code so before I move

0:11:16.330,0:11:21.250
30 pixels I'm gonna aim at the mouse

0:11:19.390,0:11:24.550
pointer and then I'm gonna move my 30

0:11:21.250,0:11:25.990
pixels that direction not 30 might be

0:11:24.550,0:11:29.290
too fast we'll adjust that later

0:11:25.990,0:11:33.070
I also liked that walking animation so

0:11:29.290,0:11:34.540
I'm gonna put that back in and so those

0:11:33.070,0:11:37.060
are the things he does forever

0:11:34.540,0:11:40.240
he points towards the mouse pointer does

0:11:37.060,0:11:42.040
a little animation moves 30 pixels if

0:11:40.240,0:11:44.800
he's on the edge he bounces well we

0:11:42.040,0:11:47.020
don't need that anymore so I want rid of

0:11:44.800,0:11:49.209
that for my code remember how you can do

0:11:47.020,0:11:51.160
that there's a left handle which will

0:11:49.209,0:11:53.110
grab it and everything after it and

0:11:51.160,0:11:55.839
there's a right handle which will grab

0:11:53.110,0:11:58.870
just it we want to grab just it and we

0:11:55.839,0:12:00.670
want to take that out of our code now I

0:11:58.870,0:12:02.980
don't need that command in my code

0:12:00.670,0:12:04.240
anymore at all so instead of setting and

0:12:02.980,0:12:07.180
over here to save it for later

0:12:04.240,0:12:10.540
I'm just gonna drop it in the trash and

0:12:07.180,0:12:12.029
so it's gone so now let's go ahead and

0:12:10.540,0:12:14.320
try it again

0:12:12.029,0:12:16.300
so now when I run it what should happen

0:12:14.320,0:12:19.329
is he should point towards my mouse

0:12:16.300,0:12:21.910
pointer and he's currently going 30

0:12:19.329,0:12:24.220
pixels we're just kind of fast and he's

0:12:21.910,0:12:26.920
trying to get it now an interesting

0:12:24.220,0:12:29.020
thing happens if he succeeds in getting

0:12:26.920,0:12:31.390
to your mouse pointer he can freaks out

0:12:29.020,0:12:33.550
you know because that actually makes

0:12:31.390,0:12:34.750
sense because he's going to try to get

0:12:33.550,0:12:38.140
it and then he goes past it then he goes

0:12:34.750,0:12:39.790
back and we'll try to fix that at some

0:12:38.140,0:12:41.560
point today but it is important to

0:12:39.790,0:12:43.300
notice that he is going towards my mouse

0:12:41.560,0:12:47.260
pointer he doesn't just zoom right there

0:12:43.300,0:12:48.400
now your code is hopefully correct but

0:12:47.260,0:12:51.040
I'm going to show you what happens if

0:12:48.400,0:12:52.899
you did it wrong so don't don't don't

0:12:51.040,0:12:54.459
let's say you grabbed that wrong one

0:12:52.899,0:12:55.329
let's say you accidentally you weren't

0:12:54.459,0:12:58.810
paying good attention

0:12:55.329,0:13:01.389
you had goto mouse pointer well go-to

0:12:58.810,0:13:04.509
mouse pointer kind of works the same but

0:13:01.389,0:13:06.069
you can see that goto he instantly jumps

0:13:04.509,0:13:09.480
there right so no matter where the mouse

0:13:06.069,0:13:11.800
is he's instantly on top of it so that's

0:13:09.480,0:13:13.660
that's an example of a bug so I'm gonna

0:13:11.800,0:13:15.220
get rid of that bug and throw it away we

0:13:13.660,0:13:18.490
just wanted to point towards the mouse

0:13:15.220,0:13:21.459
pointer alright so let's do some more

0:13:18.490,0:13:23.529
stuff so one thing that I want to do is

0:13:21.459,0:13:25.389
I'm going to teach you about variables

0:13:23.529,0:13:28.059
right so there's gonna be a lot of

0:13:25.389,0:13:30.100
variables in our code as you saw in the

0:13:28.059,0:13:32.499
one before I was collecting cupcakes and

0:13:30.100,0:13:34.360
I had five cupcakes so what I want you

0:13:32.499,0:13:36.370
to do is I want you to add a variable

0:13:34.360,0:13:39.040
and then we'll talk about it so

0:13:36.370,0:13:42.569
variables have another area TVs kind of

0:13:39.040,0:13:44.620
cut off there but it's called variables

0:13:42.569,0:13:46.720
variables are things that like to keep

0:13:44.620,0:13:49.300
track of State so like if I'm counting

0:13:46.720,0:13:50.470
I've got one two three obviously I've

0:13:49.300,0:13:52.509
got a counter and the current state of

0:13:50.470,0:13:54.730
the counter is that it's a three let's

0:13:52.509,0:13:56.290
go ahead and make a variable so fine

0:13:54.730,0:14:02.290
here in orange where it says create

0:13:56.290,0:14:04.990
variable and click it and it'll ask you

0:14:02.290,0:14:07.329
kind of a complex question it'll ask you

0:14:04.990,0:14:07.839
what do you want the variable to be

0:14:07.329,0:14:11.620
called

0:14:07.839,0:14:13.779
I'm just going to call mine food you can

0:14:11.620,0:14:16.899
use uppercase F lowercase F doesn't

0:14:13.779,0:14:18.699
matter just so long as you type food now

0:14:16.899,0:14:20.319
normally what I need my variables I name

0:14:18.699,0:14:22.480
them like really specific I'd be like

0:14:20.319,0:14:25.180
you know a number of food remaining but

0:14:22.480,0:14:28.029
shorter is better right so food is my

0:14:25.180,0:14:30.670
name so type in food and then we're

0:14:28.029,0:14:32.949
asked the question you want this for all

0:14:30.670,0:14:36.459
actors like does it can it can everybody

0:14:32.949,0:14:40.779
see this variable or just this one I'm

0:14:36.459,0:14:43.149
gonna choose to say all actors so I

0:14:40.779,0:14:45.550
could go into two what that means like

0:14:43.149,0:14:47.410
global variables versus other but I want

0:14:45.550,0:14:48.970
other people to change it I want my food

0:14:47.410,0:14:50.170
to be able to change as well so I'm

0:14:48.970,0:14:51.939
gonna say hey make it available for

0:14:50.170,0:14:53.769
everybody I'm not going to worry about

0:14:51.939,0:14:57.160
any of the other advanced features I'm

0:14:53.769,0:15:00.189
just gonna say create so now I have a

0:14:57.160,0:15:03.209
variable whenever I run my program it

0:15:00.189,0:15:06.119
has some value but the problem is if I

0:15:03.209,0:15:08.339
wrong you can't see it right you don't

0:15:06.119,0:15:10.110
like it's there but it just doesn't do

0:15:08.339,0:15:12.809
anything I want to add something called

0:15:10.110,0:15:14.639
a watcher so that we can see this

0:15:12.809,0:15:15.990
variable in action and there might still

0:15:14.639,0:15:17.480
be a bug with this but we'll see in a

0:15:15.990,0:15:21.029
minute so here's what I want to do

0:15:17.480,0:15:24.149
inside barriers you're in here click on

0:15:21.029,0:15:27.540
food see this orange button that says

0:15:24.149,0:15:29.220
add watcher we want to add a watcher now

0:15:27.540,0:15:30.509
when you click this button watch over

0:15:29.220,0:15:34.829
here to see what happens so I click add

0:15:30.509,0:15:38.939
watcher and it created another actor

0:15:34.829,0:15:41.339
it created a food watcher I'm going to

0:15:38.939,0:15:44.009
click on food watcher down here at the

0:15:41.339,0:15:46.379
bottom and you can see that my food

0:15:44.009,0:15:49.499
watcher has code in it as well

0:15:46.379,0:15:52.050
now there is one bug in this code but

0:15:49.499,0:15:54.389
I'll fix it in just a second now my

0:15:52.050,0:15:56.879
watcher doesn't move so I'm just going

0:15:54.389,0:15:58.860
to put it somewhere to where it's kind

0:15:56.879,0:16:00.720
of out of the way you can choose the

0:15:58.860,0:16:02.249
corner I'm going to choose the upper

0:16:00.720,0:16:06.600
left here you could pick any corner you

0:16:02.249,0:16:08.670
wanted and the bug in this by the way is

0:16:06.600,0:16:11.100
right now it says property food of

0:16:08.670,0:16:14.399
monster but really this should say of

0:16:11.100,0:16:16.470
any that's just a bug hopefully tinker

0:16:14.399,0:16:18.959
fixes that one but switch that to say

0:16:16.470,0:16:21.540
from any and then will will show you

0:16:18.959,0:16:27.749
using it so right now if I run my

0:16:21.540,0:16:31.230
program it should say food a zero there

0:16:27.749,0:16:36.119
oh I forget things all the time let's go

0:16:31.230,0:16:38.459
set our very good so made a watcher so

0:16:36.119,0:16:40.589
we can see the value but we haven't

0:16:38.459,0:16:42.899
given it about you yet let's go back

0:16:40.589,0:16:45.209
into the monsters code so this is the

0:16:42.899,0:16:48.209
food Watchers codes go back into your

0:16:45.209,0:16:49.949
monster and let's set the variable I'm

0:16:48.209,0:17:01.049
going to set mine to five to start with

0:16:49.949,0:17:14.209
got a question from gonna pause for

0:17:01.049,0:17:16.020
problems there's two good options one is

0:17:14.209,0:17:18.570
you can

0:17:16.020,0:17:21.560
use your mouse to kind of scroll over or

0:17:18.570,0:17:24.780
you could zoom out so right here that -

0:17:21.560,0:17:27.750
has a zoom out and then you can see it

0:17:24.780,0:17:37.590
okay also your code is running right now

0:17:27.750,0:17:41.280
so the substring property food of actor

0:17:37.590,0:17:43.530
switch it to of any which technically

0:17:41.280,0:17:44.730
works better but but not that important

0:17:43.530,0:17:46.970
now the other thing that's weird about

0:17:44.730,0:17:49.860
yours is where is your food watch rack

0:17:46.970,0:17:51.990
the answer is it's right over here

0:17:49.860,0:17:53.700
so it kind of got moved over to the Edit

0:17:51.990,0:17:58.410
screen so see if you can drag it to the

0:17:53.700,0:18:00.090
upper corner mom it was holding the

0:17:58.410,0:18:02.130
mouse but the Bowen said that he needed

0:18:00.090,0:18:03.810
to take over so see if you can drag that

0:18:02.130,0:18:05.280
yeah Bowen knows just what to do

0:18:03.810,0:18:10.440
put that right up in the corner great

0:18:05.280,0:18:12.660
job though Keegan's got a question so

0:18:10.440,0:18:14.280
Keegan says why is there a food walk

0:18:12.660,0:18:17.190
here in a food watch for one because he

0:18:14.280,0:18:18.960
accidentally clicked watch twice no big

0:18:17.190,0:18:21.260
deal so just delete the extra one so

0:18:18.960,0:18:34.560
click on the three dots here Keegan and

0:18:21.260,0:18:39.090
click on delete and say yes okay yeah

0:18:34.560,0:18:40.740
alright so back to where we were this is

0:18:39.090,0:18:42.840
how camp really works except for there's

0:18:40.740,0:18:45.570
room for like 20 people right and we

0:18:42.840,0:18:47.100
pause for questions all the time by the

0:18:45.570,0:18:48.990
way when you have questions I know you

0:18:47.100,0:18:51.780
can't ask the video but we do have

0:18:48.990,0:18:52.350
office hours I'll send the link at that

0:18:51.780,0:18:54.930
slant

0:18:52.350,0:18:57.150
slash camp page and watch the video

0:18:54.930,0:19:00.330
about office hours for that so I want to

0:18:57.150,0:19:01.890
set food to five that's my goal so I'm

0:19:00.330,0:19:04.860
still in the variables area which is

0:19:01.890,0:19:07.980
good and I look down here for this one

0:19:04.860,0:19:10.620
that's called set so it says set and

0:19:07.980,0:19:13.230
then it's got kind of like an arrow to

0:19:10.620,0:19:15.450
zero and what I want to do is the very

0:19:13.230,0:19:17.790
first thing in my program I'm going to

0:19:15.450,0:19:19.350
drop it I'm on my monster I'm going to

0:19:17.790,0:19:24.460
drop it right here I'm going to say set

0:19:19.350,0:19:26.860
food to five

0:19:24.460,0:19:30.549
and now when I run it what should happen

0:19:26.860,0:19:33.909
is it should say food and spas

0:19:30.549,0:19:36.580
now variables don't have to be visible

0:19:33.909,0:19:38.080
on the screen oftentimes variables in

0:19:36.580,0:19:40.029
programmer just hidden they're inside

0:19:38.080,0:19:41.830
your computer somewhere but because

0:19:40.029,0:19:43.990
we're learning about variables we do

0:19:41.830,0:19:49.059
want to put a watcher on art appear so

0:19:43.990,0:20:03.279
that we can see it right cool campers

0:19:49.059,0:20:04.840
you doing good yep you totally could so

0:20:03.279,0:20:07.749
the question is could you start it at

0:20:04.840,0:20:10.179
zero and count up or do you have to

0:20:07.749,0:20:11.889
start at five we can now I choose to do

0:20:10.179,0:20:17.279
a countdown so I'm going to start five

0:20:11.889,0:20:21.549
and then get last as I go now in order

0:20:17.279,0:20:23.529
in order to actually get this variable

0:20:21.549,0:20:26.259
to count down we're going to need other

0:20:23.529,0:20:28.059
actors I'm going to use cupcakes but you

0:20:26.259,0:20:29.649
can use any food item you'd like I'm

0:20:28.059,0:20:31.840
gonna use cupcakes and when I collect

0:20:29.649,0:20:35.980
those cupcakes the counter is gonna get

0:20:31.840,0:20:40.690
lower and lower so campers we all ready

0:20:35.980,0:20:45.249
to add a new actor all right so click on

0:20:40.690,0:20:47.499
add actor now there's different ways you

0:20:45.249,0:20:50.289
can add actors you can draw an actor

0:20:47.499,0:20:52.240
from scratch we'll do that sometime you

0:20:50.289,0:20:53.710
can have it be a character builder which

0:20:52.240,0:20:55.749
is kind of like an advanced thing like

0:20:53.710,0:20:57.190
my monster or you can just use their

0:20:55.749,0:20:58.869
media library which is some of their

0:20:57.190,0:21:01.149
safe things that's what we're gonna do

0:20:58.869,0:21:02.230
so we're gonna say media library we use

0:21:01.149,0:21:04.029
a couple of those different things but

0:21:02.230,0:21:07.059
media libraries will what now

0:21:04.029,0:21:09.039
and now what we want to do is we want

0:21:07.059,0:21:11.710
our monster to collect something I'm

0:21:09.039,0:21:12.820
going to use cupcakes but you can use

0:21:11.710,0:21:15.730
whatever you'd like

0:21:12.820,0:21:19.210
so cupcakes are probably in the cooking

0:21:15.730,0:21:21.490
area and so I'm going to look around for

0:21:19.210,0:21:23.919
a delicious food in here if you wanted

0:21:21.490,0:21:25.869
to use cakes or maybe your monster likes

0:21:23.919,0:21:28.840
cheese you could do whatever you want

0:21:25.869,0:21:31.299
but I'm going to do a cupcake because I

0:21:28.840,0:21:34.570
love cupcakes so I'm gonna click on this

0:21:31.299,0:21:37.029
cupcake right here and you'll see that

0:21:34.570,0:21:38.140
that did a couple of things I'm curious

0:21:37.029,0:21:43.240
what I can't

0:21:38.140,0:21:46.360
Fix Keegan picked a bomb so he's gonna

0:21:43.240,0:21:48.930
collect bombs bowen picked Oh a big

0:21:46.360,0:21:53.200
birthday cake that looks yummy both and

0:21:48.930,0:21:55.960
McKinley picked a coin so she's gonna

0:21:53.200,0:21:59.290
collect coins so everybody can do their

0:21:55.960,0:22:01.660
own thing to make it their game so

0:21:59.290,0:22:03.340
whatever I add this actor a couple of

0:22:01.660,0:22:05.020
things happen the first thing you'll

0:22:03.340,0:22:07.090
notice is that there's a giant cupcake

0:22:05.020,0:22:08.530
on my screen that's a little big like

0:22:07.090,0:22:17.020
this monster can only handle so much

0:22:08.530,0:22:19.240
cupcake that's a little bit yeah so it

0:22:17.020,0:22:21.700
depends on your actor that you added

0:22:19.240,0:22:23.710
whether it's big or tiny so they've all

0:22:21.700,0:22:24.880
said that there's a super tiny so they

0:22:23.710,0:22:28.300
might need to make theirs a little

0:22:24.880,0:22:31.450
bigger but mine came in super big and

0:22:28.300,0:22:34.230
you need to resize it so that it's a

0:22:31.450,0:22:37.360
reasonable size so I'm gonna make mine

0:22:34.230,0:22:39.760
maybe this big and I'm just gonna put it

0:22:37.360,0:22:41.500
somewhere in my scene that kind of makes

0:22:39.760,0:22:44.140
sense so I'm gonna set my cupcake all

0:22:41.500,0:22:47.580
right on the counter top and so now I've

0:22:44.140,0:22:50.260
got a cupcake up there now the cupcake

0:22:47.580,0:22:50.920
can have code you can see it's currently

0:22:50.260,0:22:53.200
empty

0:22:50.920,0:22:55.750
he can have code and he can up things

0:22:53.200,0:22:58.780
that he does what the cupcake is gonna

0:22:55.750,0:23:01.480
do is the cupcake is gonna watch if the

0:22:58.780,0:23:03.970
monster hits him and then if the monster

0:23:01.480,0:23:06.280
does hit him he's going to hide and

0:23:03.970,0:23:08.740
change the variable right so I make

0:23:06.280,0:23:10.570
sense let's go ahead and write some code

0:23:08.740,0:23:12.250
for the cupcake now eventually we're

0:23:10.570,0:23:13.750
gonna have five but don't duplicate it

0:23:12.250,0:23:15.280
yet wait till we finish it and then

0:23:13.750,0:23:17.710
duplicate it then you only have to write

0:23:15.280,0:23:18.330
that code once instead of five times so

0:23:17.710,0:23:22.360
that makes sense

0:23:18.330,0:23:24.130
all right cupcake code the first thing

0:23:22.360,0:23:25.860
you need for code is an event should go

0:23:24.130,0:23:29.260
to the events tab

0:23:25.860,0:23:32.890
the most common event is called on start

0:23:29.260,0:23:34.780
so go ahead and drag that over if you

0:23:32.890,0:23:37.150
happen to be familiar with scratch this

0:23:34.780,0:23:39.940
is similar to the on green flag clicked

0:23:37.150,0:23:42.940
but in Tinker it's called it's called on

0:23:39.940,0:23:44.830
starter and so now we're gonna have code

0:23:42.940,0:23:46.210
that's inside this cupcake now I'm going

0:23:44.830,0:23:49.480
to tell the cupcake to do something

0:23:46.210,0:23:51.910
forever so just like before

0:23:49.480,0:23:52.780
I go to control so it's in a different

0:23:51.910,0:23:57.220
category

0:23:52.780,0:23:58.750
I find the command called forever I'm

0:23:57.220,0:24:02.230
going to say hey cupcake do this forever

0:23:58.750,0:24:04.810
I really want to go tell people to do

0:24:02.230,0:24:06.670
things forever right but I'll resist the

0:24:04.810,0:24:09.820
urge and what the cupcake is going to do

0:24:06.670,0:24:11.950
forever is he's going to always check am

0:24:09.820,0:24:14.230
i touching the monster am i touching the

0:24:11.950,0:24:17.220
monster am i touching the monster and if

0:24:14.230,0:24:20.050
he is then he's going to do something so

0:24:17.220,0:24:21.640
inside of this forever loop we want him

0:24:20.050,0:24:24.880
to check am i touching the monster

0:24:21.640,0:24:27.730
that's called an if-statement so an if

0:24:24.880,0:24:30.220
statement is also in control so you can

0:24:27.730,0:24:33.190
just kind of drag it over and what he

0:24:30.220,0:24:34.900
says is if false then do something

0:24:33.190,0:24:36.310
that's just a placeholder that word

0:24:34.900,0:24:38.980
false we're gonna fix that right because

0:24:36.310,0:24:43.960
we wanted to say if I'm touching the

0:24:38.980,0:24:45.610
monster then do stuff so see that shape

0:24:43.960,0:24:49.120
for the word false it's kind of like a

0:24:45.610,0:24:52.150
little hexagon right go to a new

0:24:49.120,0:24:55.000
category called sensing and we're gonna

0:24:52.150,0:24:58.570
look for that same shape so sensing you

0:24:55.000,0:24:59.770
can see it's color-coordinated and you

0:24:58.570,0:25:01.660
can see that there's a lot of things

0:24:59.770,0:25:04.330
that are that shape so we can put things

0:25:01.660,0:25:05.920
in there so there's one yep I'm touching

0:25:04.330,0:25:06.850
the mouse pointer I can put that in

0:25:05.920,0:25:08.680
there

0:25:06.850,0:25:10.840
if I'm touching a clone of the mouse

0:25:08.680,0:25:13.240
pointer what does that even mean if I'm

0:25:10.840,0:25:15.460
touching some color and so the question

0:25:13.240,0:25:18.010
is we wanted one that said if I'm

0:25:15.460,0:25:20.860
touching the monster do something but is

0:25:18.010,0:25:24.040
not on there turns out that this command

0:25:20.860,0:25:25.870
right here touching mouse pointer you

0:25:24.040,0:25:26.500
can change the word Mouse corner to

0:25:25.870,0:25:29.260
something different

0:25:26.500,0:25:31.870
so take touching mouse pointer which is

0:25:29.260,0:25:33.580
that correct shape and get it to drop in

0:25:31.870,0:25:34.810
here by the way you get better at

0:25:33.580,0:25:37.510
dropping things in but you can kind of

0:25:34.810,0:25:40.270
see when it's gonna work because the the

0:25:37.510,0:25:42.550
box changes to kind of grow until let it

0:25:40.270,0:25:43.990
fit in here right and you can see that

0:25:42.550,0:25:45.790
it actually uses kind of the left edge

0:25:43.990,0:25:47.770
for deciding when it's in there not

0:25:45.790,0:25:49.300
where your mouse is out so if I'm

0:25:47.770,0:25:51.310
touching the mouse pointer is not what I

0:25:49.300,0:25:54.370
want but if I click on the word mouse

0:25:51.310,0:25:56.860
pointer then I can change it to what I

0:25:54.370,0:26:00.580
want right so I want to change it to say

0:25:56.860,0:26:03.059
if I'm touching the monster and that's

0:26:00.580,0:26:06.029
the idea of block based languages

0:26:03.059,0:26:08.070
kind of human readable by the way we

0:26:06.029,0:26:09.330
really are making javascript is the

0:26:08.070,0:26:11.580
language we're really using under the

0:26:09.330,0:26:12.870
hood we won't go into this but if you

0:26:11.580,0:26:15.059
click on this button it'll show you the

0:26:12.870,0:26:17.159
JavaScript code and then I'm going to

0:26:15.059,0:26:19.320
quickly get out of it but the neat thing

0:26:17.159,0:26:21.210
is is it's the exact same as what

0:26:19.320,0:26:22.889
professional developers use it's just

0:26:21.210,0:26:24.929
with blocks it's easier for people that

0:26:22.889,0:26:27.690
aren't as good at typing right alright

0:26:24.929,0:26:29.549
so if I'm touching the monster then I

0:26:27.690,0:26:31.529
want to do a couple of things one is I

0:26:29.549,0:26:32.600
want to hide right so I want to want to

0:26:31.529,0:26:36.149
Duck and Cover

0:26:32.600,0:26:41.789
hide is something you see so that sim

0:26:36.149,0:26:45.029
looks so fine looks and we've got to

0:26:41.789,0:26:47.999
find the word hide so there's a bunch of

0:26:45.029,0:26:50.490
commands inside looks where is high

0:26:47.999,0:26:53.070
whereas high got there it is way down at

0:26:50.490,0:26:54.570
the bottom so probably easiest to scroll

0:26:53.070,0:27:01.590
to the very bottom and look from the

0:26:54.570,0:27:04.110
bottom find hobby so I went to hide and

0:27:01.590,0:27:07.230
then in addition to hiding I also want

0:27:04.110,0:27:12.299
to decrement the counter just by one

0:27:07.230,0:27:14.490
right so I've got hide so now I want to

0:27:12.299,0:27:15.659
go there's another command that I know

0:27:14.490,0:27:17.610
we're going to need to add so I'm just

0:27:15.659,0:27:20.159
going to do while I'm here if you hide

0:27:17.610,0:27:22.320
now then you probably ought to show at

0:27:20.159,0:27:24.869
some other time let's go ahead and put

0:27:22.320,0:27:26.730
this at the very top of our code I was

0:27:24.869,0:27:29.490
gonna let that be a bug that we figured

0:27:26.730,0:27:32.340
out later but just so easy to add now so

0:27:29.490,0:27:34.799
when the program starts show me just in

0:27:32.340,0:27:36.629
case I was hidden before and then

0:27:34.799,0:27:38.789
forever check for the monster and if I'm

0:27:36.629,0:27:40.429
touching the monster that I hide that

0:27:38.789,0:27:43.169
makes sense

0:27:40.429,0:27:44.909
all right so show and hide are both in

0:27:43.169,0:27:47.700
there now no bugs that we'll have to

0:27:44.909,0:27:50.580
find later let's go change that variable

0:27:47.700,0:27:54.720
so variables have a category for

0:27:50.580,0:27:58.350
variables and what we want to do is we

0:27:54.720,0:28:00.360
want to change the variable so before we

0:27:58.350,0:28:02.909
set the variable which that just like

0:28:00.360,0:28:07.730
set it to five but now we want to change

0:28:02.909,0:28:12.690
it by one so take this change by one and

0:28:07.730,0:28:15.809
put it underneath hide now the variable

0:28:12.690,0:28:16.750
that we want to change is food so say

0:28:15.809,0:28:22.390
hey change

0:28:16.750,0:28:24.070
by one now if we run it then what should

0:28:22.390,0:28:29.350
happen is it should be chasing my mouse

0:28:24.070,0:28:32.380
around and if he gets that you can see

0:28:29.350,0:28:37.120
that it changed the variable food and it

0:28:32.380,0:28:40.200
made it go from five to six so it worked

0:28:37.120,0:28:42.450
but it didn't work perfectly right

0:28:40.200,0:28:49.120
what should we change this value to

0:28:42.450,0:28:50.530
instead of one what should it be all

0:28:49.120,0:28:52.990
right I can tell by looking at my

0:28:50.530,0:28:56.350
audience that I've got some questions so

0:28:52.990,0:28:58.300
that so the the dr. Fisher came I think

0:28:56.350,0:28:59.710
I felt I did dad I came before the dr.

0:28:58.300,0:29:02.950
Fisher cam is gonna go walking around

0:28:59.710,0:29:07.560
but it should change from five down to

0:29:02.950,0:29:11.530
four if you put it into negative one so

0:29:07.560,0:29:14.650
this cupcake I think is in pretty good

0:29:11.530,0:29:17.950
shape I want five of them right so I'm

0:29:14.650,0:29:19.920
gonna duplicate it five times now when

0:29:17.950,0:29:23.380
you get into coding and you're an adult

0:29:19.920,0:29:27.070
there are more elegant ways to do things

0:29:23.380,0:29:31.090
but because we're young we're just gonna

0:29:27.070,0:29:34.420
duplicate it right and so right now I've

0:29:31.090,0:29:35.830
got two cupcakes now this will happen to

0:29:34.420,0:29:39.010
you so I'm just gonna show it to you if

0:29:35.830,0:29:41.020
I hit stop my cupcakes are gone because

0:29:39.010,0:29:42.760
they're hidden I'm what I do to bring

0:29:41.020,0:29:45.310
them back side is hit play and then stop

0:29:42.760,0:29:48.810
and then another right so I've got two

0:29:45.310,0:29:52.420
cupcakes and now I'm hit duplicate again

0:29:48.810,0:29:55.690
now I've got three duplicate again I got

0:29:52.420,0:29:57.690
four duplicate again now I got five now

0:29:55.690,0:30:00.310
I'm going to position them in my room

0:29:57.690,0:30:06.670
such that they're kind of like fun and

0:30:00.310,0:30:08.590
interesting places and I'm going to

0:30:06.670,0:30:11.050
position my monster such that he doesn't

0:30:08.590,0:30:13.030
start like right on top of them now this

0:30:11.050,0:30:15.010
is not the world's most amazing game

0:30:13.030,0:30:16.930
it's not that exciting to play over and

0:30:15.010,0:30:18.100
over again but there's concepts that

0:30:16.930,0:30:20.380
we're going to build on throughout the

0:30:18.100,0:30:24.610
week to do interesting things so now I

0:30:20.380,0:30:27.280
have five cupcakes which is great and if

0:30:24.610,0:30:29.950
I play my game I should be able to watch

0:30:27.280,0:30:31.389
my variable count down

0:30:29.950,0:30:33.279
because that because all my cupcakes are

0:30:31.389,0:30:34.870
countdowns it should count down by

0:30:33.279,0:30:37.450
negative one every time it touches a

0:30:34.870,0:30:43.929
cupcake yeah all the way to zero so I'm

0:30:37.450,0:30:45.399
chasing my mouse around and now whenever

0:30:43.929,0:30:47.049
he gets on the mouse he kind of freaks

0:30:45.399,0:30:48.399
out a little bit that's that's a feature

0:30:47.049,0:30:50.490
for now we can show you how to fix that

0:30:48.399,0:30:57.669
later but whenever I collect a cupcake

0:30:50.490,0:31:01.299
it drops to four now three now two now 1

0:30:57.669,0:31:03.519
and then finally 0 now you'll notice

0:31:01.299,0:31:06.669
that nothing really happened when I got

0:31:03.519,0:31:09.370
to 0 just all the cupcakes were gone so

0:31:06.669,0:31:12.940
your game only does what you tell it to

0:31:09.370,0:31:14.649
do so mine is supposed to say you win

0:31:12.940,0:31:16.360
right but it doesn't do that yet that's

0:31:14.649,0:31:18.370
because you ever written it yet right so

0:31:16.360,0:31:21.279
that's very common whenever you write

0:31:18.370,0:31:22.990
things so I hit stop there and all my

0:31:21.279,0:31:24.370
cupcakes are gone so I'm gonna do this

0:31:22.990,0:31:26.470
trick again where I hit play and then

0:31:24.370,0:31:27.970
stop just to bring them all back that's

0:31:26.470,0:31:30.730
just I like to see them that's just a

0:31:27.970,0:31:33.269
personal preference all right so let's

0:31:30.730,0:31:38.500
go ahead and have the have the monster

0:31:33.269,0:31:42.850
say you win when you win right all right

0:31:38.500,0:31:46.899
so I want the Monster to say it so I've

0:31:42.850,0:31:48.549
got to go to the monster's code and in

0:31:46.899,0:31:49.870
the monster you can see what he's doing

0:31:48.549,0:31:53.110
right now he's pointing towards the

0:31:49.870,0:31:55.360
mouse pointer he's animating he's moving

0:31:53.110,0:31:58.360
his 30 pixels he's waiting a little bit

0:31:55.360,0:32:00.840
which determines his speed we also want

0:31:58.360,0:32:02.440
to check to see if the variable is zero

0:32:00.840,0:32:04.840
anytime you want to check something

0:32:02.440,0:32:07.179
that's an if statement so I get pretty

0:32:04.840,0:32:12.669
used to making F favorites so good of

0:32:07.179,0:32:16.990
control the very first thing in control

0:32:12.669,0:32:19.059
is an if statement I'm just going to put

0:32:16.990,0:32:20.679
it at the bottom of my loop it doesn't

0:32:19.059,0:32:22.539
matter where it happens in the loop it

0:32:20.679,0:32:24.070
could be anywhere in there well what I

0:32:22.539,0:32:28.210
want to do is I'm going to check if my

0:32:24.070,0:32:30.700
variable is equal to something right in

0:32:28.210,0:32:35.139
my case 0 so I want to say is my

0:32:30.700,0:32:36.880
variable equal to 0 what I want to do is

0:32:35.139,0:32:39.909
I want to find another hexagon that can

0:32:36.880,0:32:43.139
help me do that and it's in operators so

0:32:39.909,0:32:43.139
I'm looking for the equals operator

0:32:43.240,0:32:45.910
you can see that there's a couple

0:32:44.140,0:32:47.530
operators this one has kind of like a

0:32:45.910,0:32:51.340
circle of edge so you know it can't be

0:32:47.530,0:32:54.400
any of those more circle edges down here

0:32:51.340,0:32:56.530
it says boolean as the category and I'm

0:32:54.400,0:32:59.620
looking for a command that has an equal

0:32:56.530,0:33:03.190
symbol it looks like it's the second one

0:32:59.620,0:33:05.650
down I in the boolean area so does this

0:33:03.190,0:33:07.570
equal this and it's a diamond so you

0:33:05.650,0:33:11.020
know that it can go into that diamond

0:33:07.570,0:33:15.040
box drop it right in there now I want to

0:33:11.020,0:33:18.340
check my variable against some number so

0:33:15.040,0:33:20.290
I have to go to variables this getting

0:33:18.340,0:33:22.720
good at bouncing around categories is a

0:33:20.290,0:33:25.450
very important skill so so make sure you

0:33:22.720,0:33:27.670
practice it and I want to check my

0:33:25.450,0:33:31.110
variable I have to scroll up some and

0:33:27.670,0:33:34.059
here's my variable food so I take food

0:33:31.110,0:33:40.809
and I drop it into one side of this

0:33:34.059,0:33:43.300
equals test and I say if food equals and

0:33:40.809,0:33:46.059
not have to pick my number I am starting

0:33:43.300,0:33:50.050
at five and I'm counting down and so

0:33:46.059,0:33:51.820
when I get to zero that means you win if

0:33:50.050,0:33:53.380
you're counting up you'll have to change

0:33:51.820,0:33:55.420
your number is appropriate for what you

0:33:53.380,0:33:58.630
want to do right so you can do whatever

0:33:55.420,0:34:02.620
you want to do but when I get to zero

0:33:58.630,0:34:05.860
I win now I'm gonna say you win just be

0:34:02.620,0:34:08.109
a like a dialog box and a dialog box is

0:34:05.860,0:34:11.169
something you can see so the category

0:34:08.109,0:34:17.139
we're looking for is looks so go down

0:34:11.169,0:34:19.810
the whoops now what we want to do is we

0:34:17.139,0:34:22.780
want to say you win for some number of

0:34:19.810,0:34:24.940
seconds so I just kind of scroll down

0:34:22.780,0:34:28.119
through here for them there's a category

0:34:24.940,0:34:30.369
called speech bubbles there's a couple

0:34:28.119,0:34:32.740
of different speech bubbles you can see

0:34:30.369,0:34:34.869
there's these big scary two that have

0:34:32.740,0:34:37.240
lots and lots of options on them they're

0:34:34.869,0:34:39.520
my favorites and then there's the really

0:34:37.240,0:34:43.659
simple ones down here like say hello for

0:34:39.520,0:34:46.090
two seconds I like simple but I don't

0:34:43.659,0:34:48.010
like the font size of it so I'm going to

0:34:46.090,0:34:49.540
use the big scary box so I'm going to

0:34:48.010,0:34:51.730
use this very top them there looks like

0:34:49.540,0:34:55.109
it has a bazillion options and I'm gonna

0:34:51.730,0:34:56.940
drop it in here it

0:34:55.109,0:34:59.400
I got the wrong one don't grab the top

0:34:56.940,0:35:01.259
one grab-grab down grab the top of I

0:34:59.400,0:35:06.180
said grab the top one but then I grabbed

0:35:01.259,0:35:08.640
the second one so we want say hello for

0:35:06.180,0:35:10.289
two seconds you notice that the second

0:35:08.640,0:35:13.589
one didn't have to for two seconds right

0:35:10.289,0:35:19.680
now instead of saying hello type in some

0:35:13.589,0:35:21.509
different message you can say you win or

0:35:19.680,0:35:23.009
something like that or whatever your

0:35:21.509,0:35:26.700
monster name say whatever you want right

0:35:23.009,0:35:27.119
so shows like bones bones got a crazy

0:35:26.700,0:35:31.200
idea

0:35:27.119,0:35:33.390
Bolin what is your monster gonna say you

0:35:31.200,0:35:34.769
win yum yum and mom's gonna help type it

0:35:33.390,0:35:36.869
for him because there's no reason to

0:35:34.769,0:35:40.499
make them tight to the you win yum yum

0:35:36.869,0:35:44.969
message and now by default it uses a

0:35:40.499,0:35:47.579
really tiny font it uses 18 instead of

0:35:44.969,0:35:51.569
an 18 I'm gonna make it a bigger number

0:35:47.579,0:35:53.519
I'm gonna make it be 48 now that 18 you

0:35:51.569,0:35:56.459
can switch it to whatever you want but I

0:35:53.519,0:36:01.259
happen to know that 18 is tiny so I'm

0:35:56.459,0:36:04.559
gonna switch it to 48 also being a big

0:36:01.259,0:36:08.039
nerd it's currently going to show up as

0:36:04.559,0:36:11.190
a bottom message box I don't want that I

0:36:08.039,0:36:14.819
want it to be like a speech bubble right

0:36:11.190,0:36:17.699
so you can use a rectangular speech

0:36:14.819,0:36:19.619
bubble or a rounded speech bubble

0:36:17.699,0:36:22.289
doesn't matter right I'm just going to

0:36:19.619,0:36:23.910
pick pick what you want there and you

0:36:22.289,0:36:26.160
can also change the colors but I'm not

0:36:23.910,0:36:29.509
going to go into the colors right so

0:36:26.160,0:36:33.809
let's go ahead and see if this works

0:36:29.509,0:36:37.589
so now food is five and he's following

0:36:33.809,0:36:41.339
my mouse so now food is for food is

0:36:37.589,0:36:47.069
three to one and then when I hit this

0:36:41.339,0:36:51.029
last one it should say you win and it

0:36:47.069,0:36:53.309
works now there is a minor problem it's

0:36:51.029,0:36:56.249
not a big problem but my game is still

0:36:53.309,0:36:58.589
playing and my game is still saying you

0:36:56.249,0:37:00.989
win every two seconds right so the game

0:36:58.589,0:37:03.229
is like still going right so you've won

0:37:00.989,0:37:06.239
the game the game is over

0:37:03.229,0:37:08.790
but the games still going how do we make

0:37:06.239,0:37:10.500
the game stop

0:37:08.790,0:37:15.120
yeah there's got to be some command for

0:37:10.500,0:37:17.460
stop right so our last bit of code is we

0:37:15.120,0:37:19.440
want the game to stop now one way to

0:37:17.460,0:37:23.610
stop it is to hit the stop button by the

0:37:19.440,0:37:25.110
way I like to bring my my cupcakes back

0:37:23.610,0:37:27.690
so I hit play and stop just to bring

0:37:25.110,0:37:30.360
them back personal choice now if I want

0:37:27.690,0:37:32.940
the game to stop that is a control type

0:37:30.360,0:37:37.950
of thing and so it must be a command

0:37:32.940,0:37:40.830
that's in the control area stop is the

0:37:37.950,0:37:43.500
very very bottom one so scroll to the

0:37:40.830,0:37:49.110
very very bottom of control and finally

0:37:43.500,0:37:51.210
this stop all commands now I'm going to

0:37:49.110,0:37:53.130
show you where it goes but then I'm

0:37:51.210,0:37:56.690
gonna do it wrong intentionally right

0:37:53.130,0:38:00.000
here's where it goes it goes just below

0:37:56.690,0:38:02.310
saying you win right so it goes right

0:38:00.000,0:38:04.830
there so you put yours right there right

0:38:02.310,0:38:06.990
so it's gonna say you win for two

0:38:04.830,0:38:10.740
seconds and then it's just gonna stop

0:38:06.990,0:38:15.990
the program right so it goes immediately

0:38:10.740,0:38:18.270
after the textbox stop all right you put

0:38:15.990,0:38:20.910
it there I'm gonna show you a bug this

0:38:18.270,0:38:23.190
is an annoying bug let's say that I

0:38:20.910,0:38:27.690
wasn't paying good attention let's say

0:38:23.190,0:38:29.160
that I put it right here and you're like

0:38:27.690,0:38:32.130
well that looks like it's the same place

0:38:29.160,0:38:35.970
it's not alright so you can see that

0:38:32.130,0:38:38.850
it's not because the if statement does

0:38:35.970,0:38:41.190
these things and stop is not inside of

0:38:38.850,0:38:43.410
it that's bad right let's see what

0:38:41.190,0:38:46.110
happens with that bad code so here's

0:38:43.410,0:38:48.570
what happens I hit play and my game

0:38:46.110,0:38:50.820
stops right away well why did that

0:38:48.570,0:38:54.780
happen try again but it's really

0:38:50.820,0:38:56.490
annoying right so this is a bug now if

0:38:54.780,0:38:58.560
tinker does try to help you with bugs

0:38:56.490,0:39:00.750
there's this little bug symbol up here

0:38:58.560,0:39:02.790
you can try to see what's going on and

0:39:00.750,0:39:07.380
you hit this bug symbol and what it does

0:39:02.790,0:39:09.150
is it'll try to like let you see what's

0:39:07.380,0:39:10.230
happening it's got a help message in

0:39:09.150,0:39:12.720
here which you should definitely read

0:39:10.230,0:39:13.170
right what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

0:39:12.720,0:39:15.180
hit play

0:39:13.170,0:39:16.860
and you can see that goes through my

0:39:15.180,0:39:18.540
code and it shows me what all is

0:39:16.860,0:39:20.760
happening with the debugger you kind of

0:39:18.540,0:39:21.440
see it was fast there right and you can

0:39:20.760,0:39:25.220
see that why

0:39:21.440,0:39:27.980
is every time through my Luke I mean

0:39:25.220,0:39:30.470
always hit stop all so that's why it's

0:39:27.980,0:39:32.540
above right bugs were made popular by

0:39:30.470,0:39:35.030
grace after long ago but I've got that

0:39:32.540,0:39:37.850
command in the wrong spot and so I've

0:39:35.030,0:39:40.670
used the debugger there and it showed me

0:39:37.850,0:39:42.950
with that little bug symbol what was

0:39:40.670,0:39:46.250
wrong and that bug symbol can sometimes

0:39:42.950,0:39:48.620
be useful sometimes not I did that but

0:39:46.250,0:39:50.360
let's go ahead and fix mine and I want

0:39:48.620,0:39:53.300
to move it up to where it's inside of

0:39:50.360,0:39:56.960
the F statement so it only stops when

0:39:53.300,0:39:59.870
that F statement screwed so now I can go

0:39:56.960,0:40:02.960
around and collect cupcakes and it'll

0:39:59.870,0:40:06.920
say you win and then after you've won it

0:40:02.960,0:40:08.230
just stops the game right Bolan already

0:40:06.920,0:40:11.750
did is good job either

0:40:08.230,0:40:13.400
alright so that was actually the end of

0:40:11.750,0:40:15.140
the required thing I'm going to show you

0:40:13.400,0:40:17.690
some extra features that you could add

0:40:15.140,0:40:20.150
if you wanted but that's the end of the

0:40:17.690,0:40:22.700
required thing and one thing that we I

0:40:20.150,0:40:25.190
did a bad job of is we haven't saved

0:40:22.700,0:40:26.660
yeah right I don't know how much you

0:40:25.190,0:40:29.870
know about coding but I'll say that

0:40:26.660,0:40:31.940
saving is important and so before we say

0:40:29.870,0:40:38.420
that we should also give it a name I'm

0:40:31.940,0:40:40.280
gonna name mine monster feast so I just

0:40:38.420,0:40:42.080
click up there I decide what to what to

0:40:40.280,0:40:46.100
call you can also call it like coding

0:40:42.080,0:40:47.930
camp day one things like that and then I

0:40:46.100,0:40:51.110
can click on the button save or I can

0:40:47.930,0:40:53.870
also click on this down arrow any time

0:40:51.110,0:40:56.630
you make a project you can save it just

0:40:53.870,0:40:59.630
for you or you could save it and publish

0:40:56.630,0:41:02.120
it to the community I actually don't

0:40:59.630,0:41:03.410
care which one you do but I tend to

0:41:02.120,0:41:06.920
publish a lot of things through the

0:41:03.410,0:41:09.770
community just because it's fun and you

0:41:06.920,0:41:14.510
can do whatever you want so example from

0:41:09.770,0:41:16.790
day one of camp and the nice thing about

0:41:14.510,0:41:18.680
published projects is then other people

0:41:16.790,0:41:20.600
can see them so like other people in our

0:41:18.680,0:41:23.950
class can see your projects so I like to

0:41:20.600,0:41:27.080
publish mine just just so that I can see

0:41:23.950,0:41:29.630
now there's a couple extra features if

0:41:27.080,0:41:32.870
you would like to add them these are not

0:41:29.630,0:41:35.130
required at all the extra features if

0:41:32.870,0:41:37.440
you'd like to add them is I made mine

0:41:35.130,0:41:39.240
still have another variable this is

0:41:37.440,0:41:40.620
optional you don't have to do it while

0:41:39.240,0:41:43.320
they're variable to speed

0:41:40.620,0:41:46.740
notice how we slow right now so I have

0:41:43.320,0:41:48.480
another variable called speed and it

0:41:46.740,0:41:53.010
starts at 10 and then every time I

0:41:48.480,0:41:55.440
collect a cupcake I changes by 10 so it

0:41:53.010,0:41:57.540
gets 10 bigger and you can see that I

0:41:55.440,0:42:01.740
use my speed variable right here so I

0:41:57.540,0:42:03.690
say move speed pixels and so now every

0:42:01.740,0:42:05.820
time I collect a cupcake you know I

0:42:03.690,0:42:09.060
could go look at their code but it's

0:42:05.820,0:42:11.340
gonna make speed 10 bigger I chose not

0:42:09.060,0:42:12.750
to put a washer on it it's just a

0:42:11.340,0:42:16.320
variable that's just in my computer

0:42:12.750,0:42:18.570
somewhere and then when I win it stops

0:42:16.320,0:42:21.180
the game another feature that I added

0:42:18.570,0:42:22.920
which you do not have to add is that I

0:42:21.180,0:42:26.130
made it to where he gets to the mouse

0:42:22.920,0:42:28.440
he stops so instead of freaking out he

0:42:26.130,0:42:30.180
just stops when he gets there I don't

0:42:28.440,0:42:34.920
care if you do that one or not but the

0:42:30.180,0:42:37.470
way you do it is the move you wrap that

0:42:34.920,0:42:39.300
inside of an if statement and you only

0:42:37.470,0:42:41.220
move if you're not touching the mouse

0:42:39.300,0:42:43.680
pointer so if you're not touching the

0:42:41.220,0:42:45.420
mouse pointer then move but if you are

0:42:43.680,0:42:46.920
touching the mouse printer stop that is

0:42:45.420,0:42:50.880
an extra in something you don't have to

0:42:46.920,0:42:53.190
do at all alright so that is the the end

0:42:50.880,0:42:55.530
