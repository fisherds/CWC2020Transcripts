0:00:03.770,0:00:12.030
Hello I'm Dave Fisher so this is going to

0:00:07.500,0:00:13.440
be camp one day one this is the compact

0:00:12.030,0:00:15.780
version so I decided to make two

0:00:13.440,0:00:18.180
versions of this video one that kind of

0:00:15.780,0:00:20.609
like has my family in it which is kind

0:00:18.180,0:00:22.859
of like a more camp feel and kind of

0:00:20.609,0:00:24.869
like a camp look but there's a little

0:00:22.859,0:00:26.730
bit of fluff in those right and so I

0:00:24.869,0:00:27.599
thought I'd make another version that's

0:00:26.730,0:00:29.880
just me

0:00:27.599,0:00:31.560
chugging through the app and admittedly

0:00:29.880,0:00:32.940
if you watch this version you might have

0:00:31.560,0:00:34.710
to pause at something because the speed

0:00:32.940,0:00:36.870
is too fast. The goal is to try

0:00:34.710,0:00:40.530
to make it more compact for people that

0:00:36.870,0:00:42.570
prefer that style so hopefully you have

0:00:40.530,0:00:44.100
your login information you know you went

0:00:42.570,0:00:47.670
through you registered for the camp long

0:00:44.100,0:00:50.010
ago and you know how to sign in to

0:00:47.670,0:00:51.660
tynker right and so I'm going to show

0:00:50.010,0:00:53.460
you what it is we're going to make first

0:00:51.660,0:00:56.340
so I'm going to start by showing a

0:00:53.460,0:00:57.980
finished solution so here's a finished

0:00:56.340,0:01:02.850
solution for what we're gonna make today

0:00:57.980,0:01:05.010
so we're learning about tynker skills so

0:01:02.850,0:01:07.860
tynker is extremely similar to scratch

0:01:05.010,0:01:09.570
we're just learning it in tynker where

0:01:07.860,0:01:11.610
the monster is following the mouse

0:01:09.570,0:01:14.130
different places and we'll learn about

0:01:11.610,0:01:16.049
variables right now food is 5 as soon as

0:01:14.130,0:01:18.119
he gets it you can see the food went

0:01:16.049,0:01:19.380
to four also if you're an astute

0:01:18.119,0:01:20.790
observer you'll notice that he's

0:01:19.380,0:01:23.189
actually moving a little faster now that

0:01:20.790,0:01:25.560
he's got one and so now he's gotten two

0:01:23.189,0:01:27.180
so there's only three left and he's

0:01:25.560,0:01:29.100
moving even faster if he gets these two

0:01:27.180,0:01:31.229
up here now you can see he's kind of bulking it

0:01:29.100,0:01:33.689
around the screen one left and then when

0:01:31.229,0:01:35.479
he gets it it says you win so that's the

0:01:33.689,0:01:37.590
game that we're making together so 

0:01:35.479,0:01:40.710
what I want you to do is I want you

0:01:37.590,0:01:42.360
to log in to tynker I sent you a log

0:01:40.710,0:01:44.189
in and hopefully you know how to use

0:01:42.360,0:01:45.570
that if you didn't get the one that I

0:01:44.189,0:01:47.159
sent you you can still just make your

0:01:45.570,0:01:49.560
own account what we're doing here is

0:01:47.159,0:01:52.140
free to do we're just creating projects

0:01:49.560,0:01:54.299
and doing different things so go ahead

0:01:52.140,0:01:55.829
and click on new project make sure you

0:01:54.299,0:01:58.259
saw where I clicked there so I clicked on my

0:01:55.829,0:02:00.570
projects so the class is like you know up

0:01:58.259,0:02:02.159
here in the dashboard and the different

0:02:00.570,0:02:03.390
things you can do within projects is

0:02:02.159,0:02:06.060
kind of what we're focused on for this

0:02:03.390,0:02:08.459
video so I want a new blank project 

0:02:06.060,0:02:09.679
and what this new blank project is

0:02:08.459,0:02:12.720
going to be is it's gonna be called

0:02:09.679,0:02:15.990
monster feast sometimes it's

0:02:12.720,0:02:18.060
nice to title them right the start that

0:02:15.990,0:02:19.590
way you don't forget later and so let's

0:02:18.060,0:02:21.630
get more familiar with the tynker

0:02:19.590,0:02:24.690
interface so here's the tynker

0:02:21.630,0:02:26.280
interface again it's very similar to

0:02:24.690,0:02:27.660
scratch in that there's code that you

0:02:26.280,0:02:30.330
can use over here that's broken up

0:02:27.660,0:02:33.990
into different categories there's the

0:02:30.330,0:02:36.420
code for each actor they call actors in

0:02:33.990,0:02:40.530
scratch or in tynker instead of sprites

0:02:36.420,0:02:43.110
like scratch does this actor right now

0:02:40.530,0:02:44.340
has the following code and if I hit play we

0:02:43.110,0:02:46.770
can watch what he does and we're going

0:02:44.340,0:02:48.900
to understand what this code is so I

0:02:46.770,0:02:51.600
want to start that was what I hit this

0:02:48.900,0:02:54.270
button set the rotation style to left

0:02:51.600,0:02:55.740
and right so he can't like look upwards

0:02:54.270,0:03:00.090
on his back he just does left and

0:02:55.740,0:03:04.050
right and forever walk at a speed of 10

0:03:00.090,0:03:06.120
pixels per every 5 milliseconds five

0:03:04.050,0:03:08.480
hundredths of a second and if he's on the

0:03:06.120,0:03:11.640
edge you'll notice that he bounces right

0:03:08.480,0:03:13.170
getting more familiar with tynker you

0:03:11.640,0:03:15.300
can see that in the desktop mode you've

0:03:13.170,0:03:16.950
got a stage here and you can make your

0:03:15.300,0:03:19.680
stage bigger and smaller with this

0:03:16.950,0:03:21.870
handle and you can also click into this

0:03:19.680,0:03:24.570
motor here which shows the stage bigger

0:03:21.870,0:03:25.800
and then a left panel which I've never

0:03:24.570,0:03:28.110
found useful so you can switch

0:03:25.800,0:03:30.989
back and forth from the stage in the

0:03:28.110,0:03:32.550
code using that button now to be honest

0:03:30.989,0:03:34.380
that button is useful for the web but

0:03:32.550,0:03:37.019
really that buttons is for iPad users who

0:03:34.380,0:03:38.340
can only see one or the other at a time

0:03:37.019,0:03:40.080
and so they have to switch back and

0:03:38.340,0:03:42.150
forth from code to stage all the time

0:03:40.080,0:03:46.019
but we can actually see the stage is

0:03:42.150,0:03:47.820
just smaller for a little bit let's go

0:03:46.019,0:03:50.280
ahead and see if we can pick some things

0:03:47.820,0:03:52.049
up so let's take a look at this code and

0:03:50.280,0:03:55.080
let's see if we change some things to change 

0:03:52.049,0:03:57.540
what happens so if I change his move from 10

0:03:55.080,0:03:59.280
to 30 and you can see then he's going to

0:03:57.540,0:04:01.680
book it across the stage right so he's

0:03:59.280,0:04:03.690
gonna be going really fast if I did

0:04:01.680,0:04:05.790
things like taking out this animated

0:04:03.690,0:04:07.950
walk I'm gonna put this back so I'm just

0:04:05.790,0:04:09.600
going to set it over here then you can

0:04:07.950,0:04:12.630
see that he's just kind of like frozen

0:04:09.600,0:04:14.430
in that position so we can make changes

0:04:12.630,0:04:17.370
to the code we can see how the code

0:04:14.430,0:04:18.790
interacts with our actor I'm going to

0:04:17.370,0:04:21.490
put this animate walk back in 

0:04:18.790,0:04:24.490
now it's kind of one of two I'll close up

0:04:21.490,0:04:27.280
by the way I was kind of bad there

0:04:24.490,0:04:29.590
whenever you're grabbin code in tynker

0:04:27.280,0:04:32.350
you can grab that block and all the ones

0:04:29.590,0:04:33.820
under it with this left handle or you

0:04:32.350,0:04:35.800
can grab just that block with the right

0:04:33.820,0:04:38.020
handle so if I wanted to move them all I

0:04:35.800,0:04:39.670
would use the left handle if I wanted to

0:04:38.020,0:04:42.010
move just that one out I'd use the 

0:04:39.670,0:04:44.350
right handle and so that's how you move

0:04:42.010,0:04:45.520
code is with these handles now people

0:04:44.350,0:04:46.990
are in the habit of just grabbing it

0:04:45.520,0:04:49.960
from the middle the middle kind of behaves like

0:04:46.990,0:04:51.400
the left handle all right

0:04:49.960,0:04:53.560
so we're going to fix some things up in

0:04:51.400,0:04:56.740
our game the first thing I want to do is

0:04:53.560,0:04:59.230
I want the stage to not be wiped so I'm

0:04:56.740,0:05:02.140
going to click on the stage its gear

0:04:59.230,0:05:05.230
icon when I click on that gear icon I

0:05:02.140,0:05:08.020
can see that it's got costumes sounds

0:05:05.230,0:05:10.390
and then some advanced things I want a

0:05:08.020,0:05:11.680
costume right so I want to look through these

0:05:10.390,0:05:16.180
things so I'm gonna click on add background

0:05:11.680,0:05:19.150
and the one that I picked was from the

0:05:16.180,0:05:21.880
cooking category but for yours feel free

0:05:19.150,0:05:24.190
to pick any any backdrop you'd like

0:05:21.880,0:05:25.860
right so I'm gonna go with kitchen just

0:05:24.190,0:05:28.090
as I think it looks good

0:05:25.860,0:05:29.620
once I select it you can see it's

0:05:28.090,0:05:31.840
already back there but I do have to

0:05:29.620,0:05:34.720
close the style that I opened so now

0:05:31.840,0:05:36.700
my little monster is in the kitchen by

0:05:34.720,0:05:40.060
the way my little monster here his name

0:05:36.700,0:05:43.270
is actor now actor is kind of a terrible

0:05:40.060,0:05:45.160
name it's kind of like a human's name

0:05:43.270,0:05:46.840
being human right so if you were to name your

0:05:45.160,0:05:48.340
baby it's like Oh what am I gonna

0:05:46.840,0:05:52.230
make my baby I'm gonna name him human

0:05:48.340,0:05:54.460
right I'm gonna call them monster right

0:05:52.230,0:05:55.600
and so that's his name you could call

0:05:54.460,0:05:56.410
him Bernie or you could call him

0:05:55.600,0:06:00.340
whatever you want

0:05:56.410,0:06:02.740
right so he is a monster his name is a

0:06:00.340,0:06:05.140
appearently monster for me also not a great

0:06:02.740,0:06:07.720
name now Monster is gonna go around and

0:06:05.140,0:06:08.970
he wants to collect cupcakes so let's go

0:06:07.720,0:06:12.670
ahead and make some other cupcakes

0:06:08.970,0:06:14.320
cupcakes are called actors sprites in

0:06:12.670,0:06:17.230
scratch if you familiar with it

0:06:14.320,0:06:19.290
so I'm going to say add actor you can

0:06:17.230,0:06:21.550
add an actor by drawing that actor

0:06:19.290,0:06:23.650
doing a character builder by the way

0:06:21.550,0:06:24.550
this guy's a character builder some cool

0:06:23.650,0:06:26.530
things you can do with character

0:06:24.550,0:06:27.460
builders like change their horns and

0:06:26.530,0:06:28.120
things like that we'll get into that

0:06:27.460,0:06:30.580
another video 

0:06:28.120,0:06:32.050
or the media library and this is kinda

0:06:30.580,0:06:34.389
the one that I consider the most

0:06:32.050,0:06:38.050
common where I just use something from

0:06:34.389,0:06:40.450
there are several images now the thing I want is a

0:06:38.050,0:06:43.060
cupcake and so it's looks like there's a

0:06:40.450,0:06:45.100
lot of good options inside of here I'm

0:06:43.060,0:06:46.810
gonna pick the cupcake because I

0:06:45.100,0:06:49.450
like cupcakes but you can pick

0:06:46.810,0:06:52.090
anything you like now when you bring in

0:06:49.450,0:06:54.340
a sprite its image might be big or small

0:06:52.090,0:06:56.530
in the case of a cupcake it came in

0:06:54.340,0:06:59.380
quite big so I can just grab the handle

0:06:56.530,0:07:01.479
and just size it to whatever I want it

0:06:59.380,0:07:03.430
to be and then you can place it into

0:07:01.479,0:07:05.620
your scene into the spot that makes

0:07:03.430,0:07:07.150
sense so it's still about the same size

0:07:05.620,0:07:09.729
as the monster you must be a hungry

0:07:07.150,0:07:12.220
monster but the other cupcake was just a

0:07:09.729,0:07:13.930
little too big all right so let's go

0:07:12.220,0:07:15.040
ahead and look at the code for the

0:07:13.930,0:07:16.540
cupcake so you've noticed I've

0:07:15.040,0:07:19.660
accidentally clicked the stage here you can

0:07:16.540,0:07:21.280
switch through from different actors and

0:07:19.660,0:07:23.229
the stage and you can see what code

0:07:21.280,0:07:25.840
they've got so right now the cupcakes

0:07:23.229,0:07:28.120
got nothing so let's go ahead and make

0:07:25.840,0:07:29.770
some code for the cupcake and so the

0:07:28.120,0:07:32.680
first thing that I'm going to add for

0:07:29.770,0:07:35.050
the cupcake is the on start command this

0:07:32.680,0:07:37.419
is similar to scratch's when green flag

0:07:35.050,0:07:40.000
clicked so it's the same concept but

0:07:37.419,0:07:41.530
it's the most common way just to

0:07:40.000,0:07:44.050
actually add code that happens right at

0:07:41.530,0:07:47.560
the start and what we want to do is we

0:07:44.050,0:07:50.110
want to do something forever very common

0:07:47.560,0:07:52.510
to tell your your actors in your code to

0:07:50.110,0:07:55.479
do something forever be very mean to do

0:07:52.510,0:07:58.180
to a real person but in code just do

0:07:55.479,0:08:00.190
this forever and what he's gonna do is

0:07:58.180,0:08:02.710
he's gonna check to see if the monster

0:08:00.190,0:08:04.510
is touching him forever so if the

0:08:02.710,0:08:07.389
monster is touching him he wants to hide

0:08:04.510,0:08:10.690
and change a variable so we still got to

0:08:07.389,0:08:12.400
get into variables but that's his

0:08:10.690,0:08:15.970
whole mission in life so let's go ahead

0:08:12.400,0:08:18.729
and check if I'm touching the monster so

0:08:15.970,0:08:22.180
a check is an if statement and so it

0:08:18.729,0:08:25.090
says if some condition then run this

0:08:22.180,0:08:27.910
code now the some condition that I want

0:08:25.090,0:08:31.810
to put in here is am i touching the

0:08:27.910,0:08:34.810
monster so that's in sensing so you'll

0:08:31.810,0:08:37.240
get better with these different kinds of

0:08:34.810,0:08:38.960
different code blocks but what we want to do

0:08:37.240,0:08:41.720
is we want to know if we're touching the

0:08:38.960,0:08:43.490
monster or not now the command that I am

0:08:41.720,0:08:45.650
drawing in here is the top one if I'm

0:08:43.490,0:08:47.900
touching the mouse pointer that's

0:08:45.650,0:08:49.850
because mouse pointer you can change to

0:08:47.900,0:08:53.420
be something different and I want to

0:08:49.850,0:08:59.120
check if I'm touching the monster so 

0:08:53.420,0:09:01.280
if touching monster then hide so hide

0:08:59.120,0:09:03.230
is at the very bottom od looks or near 

0:09:01.280,0:09:07.460
the bottom so I'm going to take hide

0:09:03.230,0:09:10.010
here and put it right in there I can

0:09:07.460,0:09:11.870
test my code like as I build things so

0:09:10.010,0:09:14.390
the monster doesn't touch the

0:09:11.870,0:09:16.490
cupcake yet so it's not a very good test

0:09:14.390,0:09:19.010
just yet but if I were to put the

0:09:16.490,0:09:21.080
cupcake down in this path and hit run

0:09:19.010,0:09:23.630
you can see that it would in fact hide

0:09:21.080,0:09:26.000
the cupcake which is good now I do

0:09:23.630,0:09:28.880
have another problem my cupcake got

0:09:26.000,0:09:31.760
hidden but it never got shown again so

0:09:28.880,0:09:34.700
I'm gonna have to fix that so I'm gonna

0:09:31.760,0:09:37.820
take a show and put it right up here at

0:09:34.700,0:09:39.890
the top now one trick you can do to show

0:09:37.820,0:09:42.080
it is you can just hit play and then

0:09:39.890,0:09:44.390
stop right away and then your cupcake

0:09:42.080,0:09:45.650
will kind of be back I'm sure there's

0:09:44.390,0:09:48.530
some other good way I guess you could

0:09:45.650,0:09:49.850
probably just have like brought it

0:09:48.530,0:09:51.200
over and just like double clicked on 

0:09:49.850,0:09:52.880
show or something like that to show but

0:09:51.200,0:09:55.040
I kind of just like play and pause

0:09:52.880,0:09:56.540
just to burn it back so I don't really

0:09:55.040,0:09:59.270
want my cupcake to be up here on the

0:09:56.540,0:10:01.730
table but my monster right now doesn't

0:09:59.270,0:10:03.920
go up and down right he just goes back

0:10:01.730,0:10:07.490
and forth so let's fix our monster a

0:10:03.920,0:10:09.410
little bit so our monster right now he

0:10:07.490,0:10:13.100
just always goes back and forth well I

0:10:09.410,0:10:15.260
want him to move still but I want him to

0:10:13.100,0:10:17.650
point at the mouse cursor as he does

0:10:15.260,0:10:20.690
things so that's going to be in motion

0:10:17.650,0:10:23.450
so inside motion you can see there's

0:10:20.690,0:10:25.550
this go-to mouse pointer that is not the

0:10:23.450,0:10:28.460
one we want if you put that in your code

0:10:25.550,0:10:30.260
what happens is he just stays with your

0:10:28.460,0:10:32.450
mouse pointer all the time right so it's

0:10:30.260,0:10:34.130
like instantaneous so that's not the one

0:10:32.450,0:10:37.310
we want so I'm gonna get that out of

0:10:34.130,0:10:42.440
there that would be bad and instead I

0:10:37.310,0:10:45.800
want point towards ah here it is very bottom point

0:10:42.440,0:10:47.930
towards mouse pointer and you can see

0:10:45.800,0:10:51.710
that the two are different so go-to is

0:10:47.930,0:10:52.580
bad point towards is what we want and so

0:10:51.710,0:10:54.290
now

0:10:52.580,0:10:57.589
he just kind of goes towards our mouse

0:10:54.290,0:10:59.390
pointer as I move it around and if I hit

0:10:57.589,0:11:02.180
the cupcake you can see that I

0:10:59.390,0:11:05.480
successfully got it and if I hit start 

0:11:02.180,0:11:07.790
stop then I can bring my cupcake

0:11:05.480,0:11:08.510
back pretty easily cool so it's going

0:11:07.790,0:11:11.390
pretty good

0:11:08.510,0:11:13.430
so monster is moving around if he

0:11:11.390,0:11:16.010
gets to the mouse he kind of freaks out

0:11:13.430,0:11:18.709
a little bit that does make sense

0:11:16.010,0:11:20.540
because he moves past it so he turns

0:11:18.709,0:11:22.130
around then he comes back and then he

0:11:20.540,0:11:23.600
goes past it and he turns around he comes

0:11:22.130,0:11:24.200
back and he does this ping pong thing

0:11:23.600,0:11:27.980
back and forth

0:11:24.200,0:11:31.070
I consider that a feature I don't have a

0:11:27.980,0:11:33.290
need to fix it but since we're teaching

0:11:31.070,0:11:36.019
you stuff let's show you how to fix it

0:11:33.290,0:11:40.250
just so that you know if you wanted to

0:11:36.019,0:11:41.690
right and so the idea is this code right

0:11:40.250,0:11:45.019
now always points towards a mouse

0:11:41.690,0:11:48.140
pointer and always moves 30 pixels but I

0:11:45.019,0:11:51.649
want to not move 30 pixels if I'm

0:11:48.140,0:11:53.540
touching the mouse pointer so you heard

0:11:51.649,0:11:54.769
the word if in my explanation for what I

0:11:53.540,0:11:59.480
want to do so I'm gonna start with an if

0:11:54.769,0:12:02.450
statement so it's in control and what I

0:11:59.480,0:12:04.970
want to do is I only want to move in

0:12:02.450,0:12:07.100
certain situations right oh by the way

0:12:04.970,0:12:08.990
this if on edge bounce we don't need

0:12:07.100,0:12:11.029
this anymore right this is trash

0:12:08.990,0:12:12.500
code that was useful when we

0:12:11.029,0:12:14.360
weren't dieting but now we are dieting

0:12:12.500,0:12:16.209
and we don't need that trash that all

0:12:14.360,0:12:19.550
right so now it says if some condition

0:12:16.209,0:12:22.160
then move 30 pixels so I'm going to put

0:12:19.550,0:12:23.630
this back in my code right now so if some

0:12:22.160,0:12:26.209
condition which I haven't filled in yet

0:12:23.630,0:12:29.570
then move 30 pixels and this condition

0:12:26.209,0:12:31.760
is if I'm not touching the mouse pointer

0:12:29.570,0:12:35.570
so if I'm not touching the mouse pointer

0:12:31.760,0:12:38.870
then go so first I need a not nots

0:12:35.570,0:12:40.880
are in operators you have to scroll down

0:12:38.870,0:12:47.440
in operators until you find a not

0:12:40.880,0:12:47.440
here's not and I want if I'm not

0:12:47.860,0:12:53.449
touching the mouse pointer so if I'm not

0:12:50.740,0:12:55.370
touching the mouse pointer there I

0:12:53.449,0:12:56.690
didn't have to change the argument all

0:12:55.370,0:12:58.190
right so let's try that let's see if it

0:12:56.690,0:13:00.500
does it so if I'm not touching the mouse

0:12:58.190,0:13:02.709
pointer it moves like always but then if

0:13:00.500,0:13:05.120
I am touching the mouse pointer he stops

0:13:02.709,0:13:07.700
now he's also doing his little

0:13:05.120,0:13:09.950
animate thing even when he's touching the

0:13:07.700,0:13:12.110
mouse pointer and I don't like that so

0:13:09.950,0:13:16.730
I'm gonna take animate out and put it

0:13:12.110,0:13:18.820
inside here so now he will stop

0:13:16.730,0:13:21.080
animating when he hits the mouse pointer

0:13:18.820,0:13:24.650
now you notice there's a little bug here

0:13:21.080,0:13:27.350
too he kind of keeps walking until he

0:13:24.650,0:13:30.170
finishes that animation cycle maybe

0:13:27.350,0:13:32.120
I should make this stage a little bigger and so

0:13:30.170,0:13:37.100
when he hits the mouse he finishes his

0:13:32.120,0:13:38.930
animation cycle then he stops just let

0:13:37.100,0:13:41.029
things like that go you really should

0:13:38.930,0:13:43.400
but if you want to know how to fix this

0:13:41.029,0:13:46.700
one it's because there's animate which

0:13:43.400,0:13:50.480
is one way to change costumes and then

0:13:46.700,0:13:54.589
there's also switch costume now this is

0:13:50.480,0:13:57.710
interesting but walk is actually like a

0:13:54.589,0:14:00.529
list of costumes and if I exchange

0:13:57.710,0:14:01.490
animate walk to switch to costume

0:14:00.529,0:14:04.130
walk

0:14:01.490,0:14:05.630
it'll stop instantaneously right you'll 

0:14:04.130,0:14:09.529
notice that as soon as he gets there he

0:14:05.630,0:14:11.209
stops so little details like that I

0:14:09.529,0:14:12.410
recommend that when

0:14:11.209,0:14:15.110
you're coding and you're learning you

0:14:12.410,0:14:17.180
don't worry about the details in the

0:14:15.110,0:14:19.700
family video that I did I didn't even go

0:14:17.180,0:14:21.860
through all that but for you guys for

0:14:19.700,0:14:23.950
the the kind of like short video I'm

0:14:21.860,0:14:26.900
showing you the little details right

0:14:23.950,0:14:28.339
cool so we've got a monster and he's

0:14:26.900,0:14:31.339
walking around and he could pick up

0:14:28.339,0:14:35.990
cupcakes but we've got a couple problems

0:14:31.339,0:14:37.820
one is we only have one cupcake but

0:14:35.990,0:14:40.400
before i duplicate my cupcakes i want to 

0:14:37.820,0:14:41.540
change his code some and so what I really

0:14:40.400,0:14:44.600
want to do if you remember that

0:14:41.540,0:14:47.480
solution is he has a counter appear that

0:14:44.600,0:14:48.830
showed how much food was left so I need

0:14:47.480,0:14:51.470
to do two things I need to make a

0:14:48.830,0:14:54.920
variable and I need to add what's called

0:14:51.470,0:14:56.450
a watcher so I can see it so variables

0:14:54.920,0:14:58.040
are kind of one of the the points of

0:14:56.450,0:15:01.370
today so let's go ahead and make a

0:14:58.040,0:15:03.010
variable so variables are one of the

0:15:01.370,0:15:07.400
categories that's over here on the left

0:15:03.010,0:15:10.820
and you can create a variable now I'm

0:15:07.400,0:15:14.300
going to name my variable food and food

0:15:10.820,0:15:16.920
is going to be either global like for

0:15:14.300,0:15:20.609
all actors or local to just this

0:15:16.920,0:15:23.100
actor now I want food to be modified by

0:15:20.609,0:15:24.899
the cupcakes so I'm gonna say for all

0:15:23.100,0:15:27.869
actors that way it's globally available

0:15:24.899,0:15:30.109
that is gonna present a bug later but

0:15:27.869,0:15:32.459
we'll fix it so when I call it food

0:15:30.109,0:15:34.889
admittedly in a real app I might name it

0:15:32.459,0:15:37.199
like num food remaining or something

0:15:34.889,0:15:38.999
like that but but food is better because

0:15:37.199,0:15:41.489
it's short it's gonna show up in our

0:15:38.999,0:15:45.149
watcher just fine so now I've got this

0:15:41.489,0:15:46.679
variable food in general I like to go

0:15:45.149,0:15:49.970
ahead and set variables at the start of

0:15:46.679,0:15:54.480
my code so I'm gonna set food to be five

0:15:49.970,0:15:58.169
five right off the go and so now if I

0:15:54.480,0:16:00.359
run it my code it really is five it's

0:15:58.169,0:16:02.040
just you can't see it right so it's

0:16:00.359,0:16:04.769
under the hood it's hidden somewhere in

0:16:02.040,0:16:06.179
my computer right but I want to see it

0:16:04.769,0:16:09.119
just because we're learning about

0:16:06.179,0:16:10.470
variables now normally when you code you

0:16:09.119,0:16:12.779
have variables that aren't visible all

0:16:10.470,0:16:15.149
the time but since we're learning let's

0:16:12.779,0:16:16.679
definitely watch this variable the way

0:16:15.149,0:16:20.040
you do that is you click on the variable

0:16:16.679,0:16:21.689
itself and then you say add watcher and

0:16:20.040,0:16:23.069
what it does is it made this little box

0:16:21.689,0:16:23.879
in the middle of my screen which I'm

0:16:23.069,0:16:26.790
going to move up here

0:16:23.879,0:16:29.279
This surprised me but there's a

0:16:26.790,0:16:31.019
little bug inside the watcher code I

0:16:29.279,0:16:32.489
know it's hard to see in your screen

0:16:31.019,0:16:35.279
right now maybe I'll move this out of

0:16:32.489,0:16:37.499
the way a little there is a slider that you

0:16:35.279,0:16:40.470
can move across the bottom you can also

0:16:37.499,0:16:43.949
just grab it and move it here but it says

0:16:40.470,0:16:45.239
property food of monster for global

0:16:43.949,0:16:49.829
variables it's really supposed to say

0:16:45.239,0:16:51.989
property food of any I don't know why it

0:16:49.829,0:16:54.540
auto-generated the wrong code for you I

0:16:51.989,0:16:56.249
consider that a bug in Tynker but if

0:16:54.540,0:16:58.049
you want it work right you're gonna have

0:16:56.249,0:17:00.269
to go into the food watcher so it

0:16:58.049,0:17:02.369
created an actor for you and modify that

0:17:00.269,0:17:04.139
code so that it says any instead of

0:17:02.369,0:17:08.519
monster and you know it's working

0:17:04.139,0:17:11.370
because it will say food five at the top

0:17:08.519,0:17:13.860
here if it says food : with like nothing

0:17:11.370,0:17:16.639
there then it means that you have not

0:17:13.860,0:17:19.919
yet properly fixed that bug right ah

0:17:16.639,0:17:22.319
cool and it really shouldn't work with

0:17:19.919,0:17:24.299
monster I'm gonna try one more time but

0:17:22.319,0:17:27.449
yeah you can see see there whatever the

0:17:24.299,0:17:29.639
default code it shows up blank isn't that crazy

0:17:27.449,0:17:30.360
fix that tynker watch this video and

0:17:29.639,0:17:33.650
fix it

0:17:30.360,0:17:35.850
and it's only a bug for global variables

0:17:33.650,0:17:38.730
so what I want to do is when I break

0:17:35.850,0:17:41.460
collect this cupcake I want food to go

0:17:38.730,0:17:43.380
down now if you wanted you

0:17:41.460,0:17:45.930
could obviously start at zero and you

0:17:43.380,0:17:49.680
can make food go up but I'm gonna have a

0:17:45.930,0:17:51.030
countdown is kind of my goal so I'm

0:17:49.680,0:17:53.550
going to go into the code for my cupcake

0:17:51.030,0:17:55.470
and I'm going to modify my variable in

0:17:53.550,0:17:56.850
there now I don't want to set the

0:17:55.470,0:18:00.810
variable like I don't want to set it

0:17:56.850,0:18:05.460
to four I want to change it by one so I

0:18:00.810,0:18:07.770
want to change food by one and so I'm

0:18:05.460,0:18:10.260
going to say negative one because I want it

0:18:07.770,0:18:12.720
to go down alright cool so I'll go ahead

0:18:10.260,0:18:14.270
and so I'll pop up the stage just so we

0:18:12.720,0:18:17.580
can see that the counter is there

0:18:14.270,0:18:21.000
when I hit food it went to four which is

0:18:17.580,0:18:23.490
cool alright let's 

0:18:21.000,0:18:25.200
mass produce cupcakes so I happen to

0:18:23.490,0:18:27.120
know that there's one more change that

0:18:25.200,0:18:29.310
I'm going to make to it later but I'm

0:18:27.120,0:18:31.980
gonna go ahead and mass-produce it now

0:18:29.310,0:18:34.610
so you can see the downside of early

0:18:31.980,0:18:39.180
mass production right so duplicate

0:18:34.610,0:18:42.630
and so there I now have five cupcakes

0:18:39.180,0:18:44.970
I'm gonna choose to set them on my scene

0:18:42.630,0:18:46.410
in different spots maybe I'll put a

0:18:44.970,0:18:48.420
couple on the floor or a couple of here

0:18:46.410,0:18:50.940
I do recommend that you don't put them

0:18:48.420,0:18:53.340
too close to your monster because if he

0:18:50.940,0:18:56.400
grabs them off the go it's gonna be hard

0:18:53.340,0:18:59.220
to figure out what's going on being

0:18:56.400,0:19:00.990
OCD I'm going to name my cupcakes you can

0:18:59.220,0:19:03.450
see it kind of tried to go in unique

0:19:00.990,0:19:05.970
names but it didn't like name them as

0:19:03.450,0:19:09.150
logically as I would have so I'm going

0:19:05.970,0:19:11.250
to rename them one two three four five

0:19:09.150,0:19:12.960
and so you just single click into that

0:19:11.250,0:19:16.680
area and rename them one two three four

0:19:12.960,0:19:18.240
five cool and so now if I run it as I

0:19:16.680,0:19:21.960
collect these things oops lets make it

0:19:18.240,0:19:25.380
bigger it says three two one and then

0:19:21.960,0:19:29.520
here it says zero now whenever I get to

0:19:25.380,0:19:32.400
zero nothing really happens right so

0:19:29.520,0:19:35.520
we're doing good but we want something

0:19:32.400,0:19:38.520
to happen we want the Monster to say you

0:19:35.520,0:19:41.730
win and the game to stop when we get to zero

0:19:38.520,0:19:43.140
so let's go and add that code so for the

0:19:41.730,0:19:46.170
monster

0:19:43.140,0:19:49.559
I want to always check if that variable

0:19:46.170,0:19:51.690
is zero so I need to add an if statement

0:19:49.559,0:19:53.670
you can put it anywhere inside the

0:19:51.690,0:19:56.250
monsters loop I'm gonna put it right at

0:19:53.670,0:19:58.770
the bottom and I want to check if that

0:19:56.250,0:20:01.200
variable is zero well all my cupcakes

0:19:58.770,0:20:04.799
are gone i want them back so I hit play stop

0:20:01.200,0:20:09.960
alright now they're back so if that variable is

0:20:04.799,0:20:12.150
zero then do stuff equals is an operator

0:20:09.960,0:20:14.670
so we've got to go into the operators

0:20:12.150,0:20:18.140
area and here's equals and we'll just

0:20:14.670,0:20:24.929
drop it in here and we want to say if

0:20:18.140,0:20:27.299
food is equal to zero then we want to do

0:20:24.929,0:20:29.760
stuff now if you wanted to you could

0:20:27.299,0:20:31.380
have made food start at zero and you

0:20:29.760,0:20:33.030
could make each of these count up and

0:20:31.380,0:20:35.520
then this would be like it food equals

0:20:33.030,0:20:37.770
five but mine's a countdown

0:20:35.520,0:20:40.350
so I want food equals zero now if that

0:20:37.770,0:20:43.260
happens I want to say you win so I'm

0:20:40.350,0:20:45.809
gonna go to looks and I'm gonna find 

0:20:43.260,0:20:47.340
a say block so there's really complex

0:20:45.809,0:20:49.860
scary ones up here and then there's

0:20:47.340,0:20:52.770
really simple ones down here I actually

0:20:49.860,0:20:54.450
want one of the complex scary ones and

0:20:52.770,0:20:56.309
I'm going to drop it in here and the

0:20:54.450,0:20:58.860
reason I want a complex scary one is

0:20:56.309,0:21:01.410
because it's got all the options that I

0:20:58.860,0:21:04.049
can set so I can set the text obviously

0:21:01.410,0:21:07.919
I'm gonna make it say you win I can set

0:21:04.049,0:21:10.350
what type of text box it is I'm gonna go

0:21:07.919,0:21:12.750
with a rectangular like speech bubble

0:21:10.350,0:21:13.740
the default one by the way just puts a

0:21:12.750,0:21:15.660
message at the bottom of the screen

0:21:13.740,0:21:17.640
which is cool but not what we want

0:21:15.660,0:21:19.500
here and then for speech bubbles I

0:21:17.640,0:21:21.540
happened to know that 18 is a really small

0:21:19.500,0:21:23.700
font I so I'm gonna bump it up to 

0:21:21.540,0:21:26.549
48 so I set the text set the style to

0:21:23.700,0:21:28.890
rectangular and then I set this to 48

0:21:26.549,0:21:32.940
and then the last thing I want to do is

0:21:28.890,0:21:35.070
I want to put a stop all immediately

0:21:32.940,0:21:36.929
after that text message so I'm going

0:21:35.070,0:21:40.950
to put it immediately after that text

0:21:36.929,0:21:43.980
message I'm gonna go and run it just

0:21:40.950,0:21:48.120
to see if it works so I grab a donut or

0:21:43.980,0:21:50.429
a cupcake cupcake two left and 0 so now

0:21:48.120,0:21:55.340
it says you win and the game comes to a

0:21:50.429,0:21:56.930
stop which is cool great so almost done

0:21:55.340,0:21:59.630
probably worth saving so I'm gonna click on the Save

0:21:56.930,0:22:01.850
button for now so I'm just gonna save

0:21:59.630,0:22:03.050
I'll tell what I'll do an and publish

0:22:01.850,0:22:05.770
later right now I'm still working on

0:22:03.050,0:22:05.770
it so I'm just gonna click Save

0:22:06.230,0:22:10.460
I want to fix some other little things

0:22:07.970,0:22:12.560
but I first want to show you another bug

0:22:10.460,0:22:14.540
so it happens all the time where people

0:22:12.560,0:22:18.770
accidentally instead of putting this

0:22:14.540,0:22:19.610
right below the statement there they put

0:22:18.770,0:22:22.280
it right here

0:22:19.610,0:22:24.950
now that's of course terrible because

0:22:22.280,0:22:27.590
the if statement only consists of these

0:22:24.950,0:22:30.860
things and the stop statement is

0:22:27.590,0:22:33.710
actually just right inside the forever

0:22:30.860,0:22:36.260
we break so the forever loop has the

0:22:33.710,0:22:38.480
stop statement inside of it and so when

0:22:36.260,0:22:40.010
I run my code it's just gonna

0:22:38.480,0:22:41.780
immediately stop and that's because the

0:22:40.010,0:22:44.390
first time through this loop it doesn't

0:22:41.780,0:22:46.700
point towards it does this if check it

0:22:44.390,0:22:49.310
waits does this if check and then stops

0:22:46.700,0:22:50.810
right now things like that really get

0:22:49.310,0:22:53.990
people because you're like oh my monster

0:22:50.810,0:22:56.750
stopped moving and go panic one thing you

0:22:53.990,0:22:59.390
can do is you can try to look at your

0:22:56.750,0:23:00.890
code but also this debug button can be

0:22:59.390,0:23:04.490
handy as well so if I click on this

0:23:00.890,0:23:08.750
debug button and I hit play what it'll

0:23:04.490,0:23:10.880
do is it will let me do that a little

0:23:08.750,0:23:13.280
slower so if I hit play you can see it

0:23:10.880,0:23:16.040
goes through and shows you each line of

0:23:13.280,0:23:18.560
code like as it's running and telling

0:23:16.040,0:23:21.080
you what's happening and then

0:23:18.560,0:23:22.490
when it gets to the bottom you can see

0:23:21.080,0:23:25.790
that it's hitting the stop all maybe

0:23:22.490,0:23:27.920
that's useful to you another thing you

0:23:25.790,0:23:28.610
can do is I believe you can step through

0:23:27.920,0:23:31.130
it slower

0:23:28.610,0:23:32.960
I'm not a master of the debugger you

0:23:31.130,0:23:35.270
know you can set breakpoints that's what

0:23:32.960,0:23:38.090
you can do in the bottom of control you

0:23:35.270,0:23:41.210
can put a breakpoint in and so you

0:23:38.090,0:23:42.830
know you put a breakpoint in and you can

0:23:41.210,0:23:45.050
see what happens like when it when it

0:23:42.830,0:23:46.340
hits your breakpoint right now of course

0:23:45.050,0:23:47.780
if you put a breakpoint there you've

0:23:46.340,0:23:49.220
obviously figured out what the problem

0:23:47.780,0:23:51.920
is but I just wanted to point out the

0:23:49.220,0:23:53.270
debugger because it can be useful when

0:23:51.920,0:23:55.700
you're trying to figure out these

0:23:53.270,0:23:57.110
stumpers and of course the problem is

0:23:55.700,0:24:01.130
that was just in the wrong spot

0:23:57.110,0:24:03.830
ah cool so game almost complete I'm

0:24:01.130,0:24:07.170
going to add one more feature i want the

0:24:03.830,0:24:09.900
monster to start slow and then get

0:24:07.170,0:24:12.090
faster I'm going to need another

0:24:09.900,0:24:15.240
variable so in variables I'm going to

0:24:12.090,0:24:18.030
say create variable and I'm going to

0:24:15.240,0:24:19.740
create a variable called speed and then

0:24:18.030,0:24:21.390
speed I'm going to let the cupcakes

0:24:19.740,0:24:23.610
change it so I'm gonna say it's for all

0:24:21.390,0:24:26.310
actors but really just the 

0:24:23.610,0:24:28.980
monster uses it by the way you can set a

0:24:26.310,0:24:32.340
reset value if you wanted so let's say

0:24:28.980,0:24:33.480
we wanted him to reset to ten and that

0:24:32.340,0:24:35.880
will make sure that the variable

0:24:33.480,0:24:38.490
automatically gets reset for you now

0:24:35.880,0:24:40.110
I rarely do that trick the reset variable

0:24:38.490,0:24:42.600
I was just showing you that it's 

0:24:40.110,0:24:44.880
possible and that's because I like for

0:24:42.600,0:24:47.840
it to actually be in my code so I can

0:24:44.880,0:24:50.700
see it right so I like to say in my code

0:24:47.840,0:24:53.940
set speed so I'm on the monster's code

0:24:50.700,0:24:57.480
now set speed to be ten and then I can

0:24:53.940,0:24:59.820
see it in my code as opposed to you know

0:24:57.480,0:25:02.310
they're reset on stop trick

0:24:59.820,0:25:04.320
reset on stop is useful but I prefer to

0:25:02.310,0:25:06.480
just put it in here now I want to use

0:25:04.320,0:25:09.360
speed so I want speed to be right

0:25:06.480,0:25:11.040
here so right now all I've done is I've

0:25:09.360,0:25:14.910
just made the game slower right because

0:25:11.040,0:25:17.340
I went from 30 to ten what I want the

0:25:14.910,0:25:20.700
cupcakes to do is I want cupcakes to

0:25:17.340,0:25:26.190
increase speed so cupcakes now have two

0:25:20.700,0:25:27.900
functions they make food go down and 

0:25:26.190,0:25:30.690
they make speed go up right now I've

0:25:27.900,0:25:32.760
only modified cupcake one so whenever I

0:25:30.690,0:25:35.130
get like cupcake two you know

0:25:32.760,0:25:36.930
nothing really happens or this cupcake

0:25:35.130,0:25:38.610
nothing really happens now whenever I hit

0:25:36.930,0:25:40.920
the one that is cupcake one which

0:25:38.610,0:25:43.530
was that one it did speed up but

0:25:40.920,0:25:46.260
obviously I want this this piece of code

0:25:43.530,0:25:48.120
on all my cupcakes what I'm going to do

0:25:46.260,0:25:53.090
is I'm going to drag and drop it on the

0:25:48.120,0:25:56.010
dot cupcake and that one and that one

0:25:53.090,0:25:59.040
and that one so what that did is that

0:25:56.010,0:26:01.920
actually put it somewhere in their block

0:25:59.040,0:26:03.930
of code but it didn't actually put it in

0:26:01.920,0:26:06.420
the right place so that way I just need

0:26:03.930,0:26:10.950
to go through each one and drop it into

0:26:06.420,0:26:13.560
the right place now whenever you have

0:26:10.950,0:26:16.320
multiple duplicates there are more

0:26:13.560,0:26:18.000
elegant ways to do it with clones but I

0:26:16.320,0:26:18.909
thought I'd just kind of show you a

0:26:18.000,0:26:21.429
simple

0:26:18.909,0:26:23.979
way to kind of do things great so I

0:26:21.429,0:26:26.919
think we've got a finished game so if I

0:26:23.979,0:26:28.499
run it I can see there's chasing the

0:26:26.919,0:26:31.239
mouse pointer it's going nice and slow

0:26:28.499,0:26:35.309
and then as he hits cupcakes

0:26:31.239,0:26:38.679
he hit begins to speed up cool so you win

0:26:35.309,0:26:39.879
all right so I'm ready to be done with

0:26:38.679,0:26:42.099
this thing I'm going to go ahead and

0:26:39.879,0:26:44.619
click on publish to community I just so

0:26:42.099,0:26:51.399
other people can see this and so this

0:26:44.619,0:26:59.259
is my connecting with code week one day

0:26:51.399,0:27:02.950
one exercise so I'll hit save and

0:26:59.259,0:27:04.989
publish hey since this is kind of

0:27:02.950,0:27:08.259
the advanced video maybe we'll do one

0:27:04.989,0:27:09.190
more thing together as well and the

0:27:08.259,0:27:11.950
thing that I wouldn't mind doing

0:27:09.190,0:27:13.840
together is making another example just

0:27:11.950,0:27:16.869
because it can be nice to make multiple

0:27:13.840,0:27:19.269
examples let's go ahead and see if we

0:27:16.869,0:27:20.470
can make one more actually maybe I

0:27:19.269,0:27:22.450
should make that a different video so

0:27:20.470,0:27:24.879
I'll cut this video off here and then

0:27:22.450,0:27:25.210
we'll do the other example in a separate

0:27:24.879,0:27:27.220
video
