0:00:03.859,0:00:09.300
hey welcome to connecting with code 2020

0:00:07.799,0:00:12.509
we're so glad you made it

0:00:09.300,0:00:15.330
this is our first video there's gonna be

0:00:12.509,0:00:16.430
five of these videos so each day Monday

0:00:15.330,0:00:18.810
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday

0:00:16.430,0:00:21.359
there's gonna be a video follow along

0:00:18.810,0:00:24.150
with me and what's gonna happen is I'm

0:00:21.359,0:00:26.730
doing these videos live with some

0:00:24.150,0:00:27.180
campers as you might guess I'm in my

0:00:26.730,0:00:30.090
home

0:00:27.180,0:00:32.040
so my campers are my family but I'm

0:00:30.090,0:00:33.120
going to use this camera so that you can

0:00:32.040,0:00:35.610
meet my campers

0:00:33.120,0:00:38.960
so our first camper would you like to

0:00:35.610,0:00:38.960
introduce yourself and say hello your

0:00:39.200,0:00:44.430
age a that's great

0:00:41.489,0:00:46.590
and so Keegan is going to be working by

0:00:44.430,0:00:48.840
himself today as age 8 he's a perfect

0:00:46.590,0:00:59.309
age for this camp our next set of

0:00:48.840,0:01:01.140
campers and he's age 6 and since Bowen

0:00:59.309,0:01:03.359
is age 6 he's gonna need a little bit of

0:01:01.140,0:01:09.540
help this is adult helper want to

0:01:03.359,0:01:11.970
introduce yourself yeah oh and by the

0:01:09.540,0:01:14.880
way you'll notice that mom and Keegan

0:01:11.970,0:01:18.750
are both wearing a connecting with coach

0:01:14.880,0:01:20.220
shirt very nice and then we've got one

0:01:18.750,0:01:21.150
more camper with us because I see my son

0:01:20.220,0:01:23.070
up there

0:01:21.150,0:01:25.380
so we're last camper you want to

0:01:23.070,0:01:26.130
introduce yourself finally can you share

0:01:25.380,0:01:29.310
any paged

0:01:26.130,0:01:31.320
she's H Tim and so McKinley has actually

0:01:29.310,0:01:33.750
coded for quite a while

0:01:31.320,0:01:36.659
and she might be a little advanced for

0:01:33.750,0:01:41.189
this material but she is gonna have fun

0:01:36.659,0:01:44.159
Jordans raices all right so those are my

0:01:41.189,0:01:46.979
campers and everybody is kind of ready

0:01:44.159,0:01:49.439
to go today and what I want you to do is

0:01:46.979,0:01:54.000
I want you to start off by going over to

0:01:49.439,0:01:55.829
tinker tinker is Tyn keer hopefully

0:01:54.000,0:01:57.840
you've been there from the email you got

0:01:55.829,0:02:00.719
through before and you've been able to

0:01:57.840,0:02:04.409
get signed in so you're gonna sign in as

0:02:00.719,0:02:07.740
a student and your username and password

0:02:04.409,0:02:10.590
should kind of be in the format CWC 2020

0:02:07.740,0:02:12.090
and then your name of your camper

0:02:10.590,0:02:13.860
whatever name you provided so here it's

0:02:12.090,0:02:16.710
David Fisher now

0:02:13.860,0:02:19.910
once you sign in you can see a couple

0:02:16.710,0:02:22.800
things you can see your dashboard and

0:02:19.910,0:02:25.200
your dashboard has all these ticker

0:02:22.800,0:02:26.610
coding challenges that you can work all

0:02:25.200,0:02:29.400
on your own so there's quite a few of

0:02:26.610,0:02:31.320
them that we've set up ideally you've

0:02:29.400,0:02:33.090
spent some time trying these things like

0:02:31.320,0:02:35.850
dragons spell or Barbie you can be

0:02:33.090,0:02:37.050
anything they are really well made and

0:02:35.850,0:02:38.970
you should definitely spend some time

0:02:37.050,0:02:41.550
doing it in camp we spend 20 minutes

0:02:38.970,0:02:43.230
every day doing these before we start on

0:02:41.550,0:02:45.630
like the project for that day so

0:02:43.230,0:02:48.210
definitely be aware of that but for the

0:02:45.630,0:02:49.410
videos that you do with B we're not

0:02:48.210,0:02:50.880
going to do those because you can do

0:02:49.410,0:02:54.360
those in your own we're going to be down

0:02:50.880,0:02:56.459
into my projects area I'm and then the

0:02:54.360,0:02:57.930
my projects area you probably have no

0:02:56.459,0:03:00.510
projects right now so it's probably

0:02:57.930,0:03:03.120
completely empty I've got two because I

0:03:00.510,0:03:04.110
had to practice for today and so what

0:03:03.120,0:03:05.430
we're going to do is we're going to make

0:03:04.110,0:03:07.320
a project but what I'm going to do is

0:03:05.430,0:03:09.720
I'm going to show you the finished

0:03:07.320,0:03:11.670
solution first and so at the end of this

0:03:09.720,0:03:15.450
video this is what you're going to be

0:03:11.670,0:03:17.430
able to create right so here is a

0:03:15.450,0:03:20.700
finished solution so I'm going to go

0:03:17.430,0:03:22.980
ahead and show you the game it's a it's

0:03:20.700,0:03:25.980
a pretty simple game the way this game

0:03:22.980,0:03:29.250
works is I have a one actor he's a

0:03:25.980,0:03:32.519
monster and his job is to collect

0:03:29.250,0:03:34.709
cupcakes so he likes to eat cupcakes and

0:03:32.519,0:03:36.269
so he collected this cupcake and you'll

0:03:34.709,0:03:37.860
actually notice that maybe he's going a

0:03:36.269,0:03:40.260
little faster

0:03:37.860,0:03:43.320
and every time he collects a cupcake he

0:03:40.260,0:03:45.090
gets closer and closer to winning and of

0:03:43.320,0:03:48.360
course I've made a couple versions of

0:03:45.090,0:03:50.000
this game but you can see that this is

0:03:48.360,0:03:52.890
this is the game that we're making

0:03:50.000,0:03:54.120
another thing that I wanted to show that

0:03:52.890,0:03:55.410
I forgot to show in the last what's all

0:03:54.120,0:03:57.840
I'll do a better job of saying it here

0:03:55.410,0:04:00.959
is there's a counter up in the corner

0:03:57.840,0:04:03.390
and it's counting keeping track room

0:04:00.959,0:04:06.000
variable you can make your counter go up

0:04:03.390,0:04:07.410
or down here this one's going down and

0:04:06.000,0:04:10.860
then whenever you get all the way to the

0:04:07.410,0:04:14.040
bottom eyes as you win so let's start

0:04:10.860,0:04:17.040
doing some of these things so go ahead

0:04:14.040,0:04:21.419
and go to your project area and click on

0:04:17.040,0:04:23.039
create a new project whenever you create

0:04:21.419,0:04:25.620
a new project there's a couple of

0:04:23.039,0:04:27.030
templates that you can choose from you

0:04:25.620,0:04:31.110
can click on either

0:04:27.030,0:04:33.000
blank project or blank block cluding

0:04:31.110,0:04:35.340
project I'm pretty sure that they're the

0:04:33.000,0:04:37.710
same but I'm going to choose to click on

0:04:35.340,0:04:40.889
blank block coding project just because

0:04:37.710,0:04:42.810
that's specifically what we're doing so

0:04:40.889,0:04:46.470
now it's kind of brought you into the

0:04:42.810,0:04:49.050
world of tinker tinker projects are very

0:04:46.470,0:04:51.360
very similar to scratch projects if

0:04:49.050,0:04:53.310
you're familiar with that and the way

0:04:51.360,0:04:56.540
that they work is that you have your

0:04:53.310,0:05:00.830
stage so this is my stage area over here

0:04:56.540,0:05:03.330
on your stage you have different actors

0:05:00.830,0:05:06.120
scratch columns sprite but here we call

0:05:03.330,0:05:09.960
it actors and your actors have different

0:05:06.120,0:05:12.480
code that they do right and so this

0:05:09.960,0:05:14.850
project even the blank project gave you

0:05:12.480,0:05:16.110
a little code and what we can do is we

0:05:14.850,0:05:18.540
can go through and we can look at what

0:05:16.110,0:05:20.340
this code does and then we also have a

0:05:18.540,0:05:23.070
tool box over here where we can add more

0:05:20.340,0:05:25.110
code let's start off by running our

0:05:23.070,0:05:27.510
project and seeing what our code does

0:05:25.110,0:05:30.870
right now what our code does right now

0:05:27.510,0:05:32.310
is sorry when we hit play down here on

0:05:30.870,0:05:35.040
the right you can see my code started

0:05:32.310,0:05:37.530
playing you can always stop your code

0:05:35.040,0:05:39.720
for play or start your code playing

0:05:37.530,0:05:42.539
you'll notice that once your code starts

0:05:39.720,0:05:44.220
playing your actor starts moving and you

0:05:42.539,0:05:47.010
get this green outline around your code

0:05:44.220,0:05:49.890
saying hey this code is happening let's

0:05:47.010,0:05:52.710
look at this code this code says onstart

0:05:49.890,0:05:55.169
so that's an event which means when the

0:05:52.710,0:05:57.330
game starts and so anything that's

0:05:55.169,0:05:59.729
connected below that is going to happen

0:05:57.330,0:06:02.430
where the game starts the first thing

0:05:59.729,0:06:05.010
that we do after onstart is a little

0:06:02.430,0:06:07.710
setup we do an advanced thing it's

0:06:05.010,0:06:10.220
called sent rotation style left right so

0:06:07.710,0:06:12.300
our monster he only goes left and right

0:06:10.220,0:06:14.190
learn those rights there that affects

0:06:12.300,0:06:15.930
his image and then this is interesting

0:06:14.190,0:06:20.130
we're telling him to do something

0:06:15.930,0:06:22.860
forever so forever do these things now

0:06:20.130,0:06:24.840
if I were to ask poet I say Bowen you'll

0:06:22.860,0:06:27.330
brush your teeth forever I'd be pretty

0:06:24.840,0:06:27.930
beat right yeah you wouldn't do that to

0:06:27.330,0:06:30.450
a person

0:06:27.930,0:06:31.919
but with code saying to do something

0:06:30.450,0:06:33.810
forever is just fine

0:06:31.919,0:06:35.789
in fact we do it all the time and the

0:06:33.810,0:06:38.789
thing that this monster does forever is

0:06:35.789,0:06:40.629
he animates his walk so you'll notice

0:06:38.789,0:06:43.779
that he's kind of got this animated

0:06:40.629,0:06:46.389
he's moving 10 pixels so that's kind of

0:06:43.779,0:06:52.389
how far he moves if he's on an edge

0:06:46.389,0:06:55.210
bounce and then wait 0.05 seconds that

0:06:52.389,0:06:57.069
so he doesn't go too fast and the fun

0:06:55.210,0:06:58.809
thing about code is you can take pieces

0:06:57.069,0:07:02.259
out of the code and see how it changes

0:06:58.809,0:07:04.029
the behavior in tinker there's two

0:07:02.259,0:07:07.240
handles on every block code there's a

0:07:04.029,0:07:09.219
left handle and a right handle left

0:07:07.240,0:07:12.249
handle selects that code and everything

0:07:09.219,0:07:13.389
below it right handle selects just that

0:07:12.249,0:07:17.319
line so try this

0:07:13.389,0:07:21.009
grab animate walk grab the handle on the

0:07:17.319,0:07:24.249
right and take it out of your code now

0:07:21.009,0:07:26.650
what happens is your code runs without

0:07:24.249,0:07:29.199
that command in it so you can see that

0:07:26.650,0:07:31.930
my monster is still going back and forth

0:07:29.199,0:07:34.060
it's just not walking anymore it just is

0:07:31.930,0:07:35.620
animation for walking just happening and

0:07:34.060,0:07:38.710
that's because that command isn't in

0:07:35.620,0:07:40.899
there if I put it back in

0:07:38.710,0:07:43.360
then I'll of course begin his little

0:07:40.899,0:07:45.879
walking animation you can try this with

0:07:43.360,0:07:47.560
other pieces of your code as well let's

0:07:45.879,0:07:50.919
say that instead of moving at a speed of

0:07:47.560,0:07:53.979
10 pixels he moved at a speed of 100

0:07:50.919,0:07:55.419
pixels and so now if we run it at 100

0:07:53.979,0:07:59.349
pixels you can see he goes back and

0:07:55.419,0:08:01.889
forth very fast and so this project

0:07:59.349,0:08:06.279
started with a little bit of code in it

0:08:01.889,0:08:08.319
but I actually want to practice writing

0:08:06.279,0:08:09.669
some of these things so what I'm going

0:08:08.319,0:08:12.520
to do is I'm going to take a fair amount

0:08:09.669,0:08:15.009
of this code out just just for the sake

0:08:12.520,0:08:16.569
of practice I want the heck let's just

0:08:15.009,0:08:17.349
go ahead and write it all together and

0:08:16.569,0:08:19.479
get it'll be fun

0:08:17.349,0:08:21.639
the nice thing about writing it all

0:08:19.479,0:08:23.770
together again is that if you would like

0:08:21.639,0:08:25.120
this is an advanced thing if people are

0:08:23.770,0:08:26.649
Vance let's say you don't like the

0:08:25.120,0:08:29.139
monster and you wanted to pick a

0:08:26.649,0:08:30.999
different character you could if you

0:08:29.139,0:08:32.949
wanted you don't have to do this you can

0:08:30.999,0:08:35.370
click on add actor and add a different

0:08:32.949,0:08:38.079
actor I'm gonna stick with my monster

0:08:35.370,0:08:39.760
because I think that'll be easier if you

0:08:38.079,0:08:41.469
did add something different then you can

0:08:39.760,0:08:44.290
delete your monster totally up to you

0:08:41.469,0:08:45.940
right so let's start adding our code for

0:08:44.290,0:08:47.380
our monster now we're gonna repeat some

0:08:45.940,0:08:49.839
of the things that we saw because we're

0:08:47.380,0:08:51.069
just getting started about learning how

0:08:49.839,0:08:52.900
to do this and so we're gonna start

0:08:51.069,0:08:55.089
building our monster back up

0:08:52.900,0:08:57.370
the first thing we have to do in our

0:08:55.089,0:09:00.130
code is we have to say on start this is

0:08:57.370,0:09:02.020
a very very very popular way to start

0:09:00.130,0:09:04.360
your coding projects because this is

0:09:02.020,0:09:06.160
when you click start this code runs in

0:09:04.360,0:09:08.410
scratch if you have to jump scratch this

0:09:06.160,0:09:11.110
is somewhere to win green flag clicked

0:09:08.410,0:09:12.790
right alright the next thing that was in

0:09:11.110,0:09:15.520
here which is not in here anymore

0:09:12.790,0:09:18.339
was a blue command that set his rotation

0:09:15.520,0:09:20.080
style that was kind of an advanced

0:09:18.339,0:09:22.690
command but let's see if we can find it

0:09:20.080,0:09:24.760
in our list of commands the way commands

0:09:22.690,0:09:27.880
are broken up is they're broken up by

0:09:24.760,0:09:31.089
color by category for what they do and

0:09:27.880,0:09:33.850
so if you can think about what type of

0:09:31.089,0:09:36.970
command is this you could probably find

0:09:33.850,0:09:38.200
its category pretty quickly or maybe

0:09:36.970,0:09:40.150
you're good at remembering what color

0:09:38.200,0:09:43.210
things are that command which was a

0:09:40.150,0:09:46.720
sneaky command was a dark blue and it

0:09:43.210,0:09:48.070
was called set rotation style so what

0:09:46.720,0:09:50.740
you have to do is you have to click on

0:09:48.070,0:09:52.450
the motion category inside the motion

0:09:50.740,0:09:54.850
category you have to look around until

0:09:52.450,0:09:58.000
you find the command you want and then

0:09:54.850,0:10:01.060
you drag it over and then you connect it

0:09:58.000,0:10:02.320
on to the bottom of one start now you'll

0:10:01.060,0:10:04.570
notice that whenever you connect things

0:10:02.320,0:10:06.459
they kind of snap into place but you

0:10:04.570,0:10:10.270
have to make sure that that snap happens

0:10:06.459,0:10:11.320
to get it all all so now I'm not too

0:10:10.270,0:10:13.630
worried about what this command does

0:10:11.320,0:10:16.510
we're just kind of practicing some of

0:10:13.630,0:10:19.360
these things and most commands so this

0:10:16.510,0:10:21.220
is set rotation style have these boxes

0:10:19.360,0:10:23.890
of them now click on this word all

0:10:21.220,0:10:26.410
around if you remember the code we

0:10:23.890,0:10:28.480
deleted that the code we deleted said

0:10:26.410,0:10:30.700
hey make his image to working a term

0:10:28.480,0:10:32.740
right and left but always keep his feet

0:10:30.700,0:10:34.209
at the bottom so his image can turn

0:10:32.740,0:10:36.910
right and left but his feet stay at the

0:10:34.209,0:10:38.350
bottom that's exactly what we want by

0:10:36.910,0:10:40.540
the way the code that we're writing here

0:10:38.350,0:10:43.240
is with blocks just like how scratch

0:10:40.540,0:10:44.950
worked but interestingly real software

0:10:43.240,0:10:46.540
developers they do these same things

0:10:44.950,0:10:48.130
they just type it right and the

0:10:46.540,0:10:50.170
advantage of blocks is you can just drag

0:10:48.130,0:10:53.020
and drop it over if you wanted to see

0:10:50.170,0:10:54.670
though the actual code that's happening

0:10:53.020,0:10:56.440
here there's this little button that the

0:10:54.670,0:10:58.450
JN and s you don't have to click on this

0:10:56.440,0:11:01.060
just watch this stands for JavaScript

0:10:58.450,0:11:02.770
and this will show you the code that

0:11:01.060,0:11:04.959
you're actually writing which is

0:11:02.770,0:11:05.820
JavaScript we won't look at here very

0:11:04.959,0:11:09.060
often but I'm going to

0:11:05.820,0:11:11.040
back to the blocks right now the next

0:11:09.060,0:11:13.290
thing I want to do is I want to say hey

0:11:11.040,0:11:15.960
monster I want you to do something

0:11:13.290,0:11:19.730
forever so I need to find a forever loop

0:11:15.960,0:11:21.750
a forever loop is a type of control

0:11:19.730,0:11:23.820
things that are in the control category

0:11:21.750,0:11:26.790
are like you know forever loops if

0:11:23.820,0:11:28.650
statements for loops that repeats a

0:11:26.790,0:11:32.370
number of times but see if you can find

0:11:28.650,0:11:32.720
the command that says forever there it

0:11:32.370,0:11:36.470
is

0:11:32.720,0:11:38.910
so take forever and lock it on here so

0:11:36.470,0:11:41.070
once he starts he's going to send us

0:11:38.910,0:11:42.990
your rotation style one time and then

0:11:41.070,0:11:46.410
inside of here are going to be commands

0:11:42.990,0:11:47.970
that happen forever so what I want him

0:11:46.410,0:11:50.460
to do forever is actually something

0:11:47.970,0:11:51.960
different than what he did before before

0:11:50.460,0:11:54.150
he walked back and forth in a straight

0:11:51.960,0:11:56.490
line but what I want him to do now is I

0:11:54.150,0:11:58.860
want him to point towards my mouse

0:11:56.490,0:12:00.570
pointer I said wherever my mouse pointer

0:11:58.860,0:12:02.940
is I want him to point there and then I

0:12:00.570,0:12:05.880
want him to move in that direction so

0:12:02.940,0:12:10.740
let's do this these are motions so go to

0:12:05.880,0:12:15.270
motion and I want to find a command

0:12:10.740,0:12:17.100
called point towards mouse pointer so

0:12:15.270,0:12:20.280
there's two that are kind of similar

0:12:17.100,0:12:23.670
there's go-to mouse pointer that is not

0:12:20.280,0:12:25.110
the one we want and then there's the one

0:12:23.670,0:12:30.000
that we do want down here at the bottom

0:12:25.110,0:12:31.680
point towards mouse pointer now these

0:12:30.000,0:12:33.630
commands are different one just makes

0:12:31.680,0:12:36.150
him like point at it and then the other

0:12:33.630,0:12:38.460
like zooms in there immediately I don't

0:12:36.150,0:12:40.170
want to zoom in there so I just I was

0:12:38.460,0:12:42.300
just porting that one out for what not

0:12:40.170,0:12:44.820
to do right so I want to point towards

0:12:42.300,0:12:46.350
the mouse pointer now interestingly if

0:12:44.820,0:12:48.150
you hit play in your program right now

0:12:46.350,0:12:50.730
it kind of feels like he's not really

0:12:48.150,0:12:54.930
working right because he will point left

0:12:50.730,0:12:57.030
and right but he doesn't move right so

0:12:54.930,0:12:59.700
like if my mouse is over here he sees my

0:12:57.030,0:13:02.370
mouse is over here and he points towards

0:12:59.700,0:13:03.540
the mouse now he's just doing left and

0:13:02.370,0:13:07.020
right because that's what we told him to

0:13:03.540,0:13:07.830
do not like spinning all around but he's

0:13:07.020,0:13:10.110
not moving

0:13:07.830,0:13:13.470
because we haven't written the commands

0:13:10.110,0:13:16.080
for movement yet so we have to write

0:13:13.470,0:13:18.819
some commands for movement so if we want

0:13:16.080,0:13:23.410
him to move we have to write code

0:13:18.819,0:13:29.619
to do that so inside movements at the

0:13:23.410,0:13:32.229
very top fine move 10 pixels now the

0:13:29.619,0:13:34.600
speed that something moves is a is a

0:13:32.229,0:13:37.569
function of two things it's how far do

0:13:34.600,0:13:39.939
you move and how long do you wait like

0:13:37.569,0:13:42.039
after that move so its speed is actually

0:13:39.939,0:13:44.859
distance divided by time but I gotta go

0:13:42.039,0:13:46.600
there so we're gonna move ten pixels and

0:13:44.859,0:13:47.139
then we're gonna wait for a short period

0:13:46.600,0:13:49.559
of time

0:13:47.139,0:13:53.679
otherwise it's gonna go too fast right a

0:13:49.559,0:13:56.979
weight is a type of control so a weight

0:13:53.679,0:14:01.269
is in the control area and fine where it

0:13:56.979,0:14:06.249
says wait one second and we're gonna

0:14:01.269,0:14:08.559
drag it and drop it into here now

0:14:06.249,0:14:11.679
waiting for one second actually makes my

0:14:08.559,0:14:14.289
game go too slow if I were to run it

0:14:11.679,0:14:16.499
right now he would it would work he

0:14:14.289,0:14:20.979
would he would move towards my cursor

0:14:16.499,0:14:22.569
it's just really slow and it would

0:14:20.979,0:14:24.459
eventually get kind of boring to watch

0:14:22.569,0:14:27.459
him move at a snail's pace

0:14:24.459,0:14:30.179
I think I'm bored now and so what I want

0:14:27.459,0:14:34.299
to do is I want to make him go faster

0:14:30.179,0:14:36.369
now the speed that I like to use is I

0:14:34.299,0:14:42.279
like to use a weight it's kind of a

0:14:36.369,0:14:43.629
funny number of 0.05 so you can have

0:14:42.279,0:14:46.359
your adult hope you typed if you want

0:14:43.629,0:14:49.659
there now what this is is this is one

0:14:46.359,0:14:51.819
twentieth of a second and I found that

0:14:49.659,0:14:55.509
it's kind of a speed that makes my game

0:14:51.819,0:14:57.879
look pretty good right it's also called

0:14:55.509,0:15:01.600
twenty frames per second as soon as you

0:14:57.879,0:15:04.239
get into games now right now my monster

0:15:01.600,0:15:06.159
is going towards my mouse and if it gets

0:15:04.239,0:15:07.539
there it kind of freaks out I consider

0:15:06.159,0:15:10.329
that a feature just going to leave that

0:15:07.539,0:15:13.809
feature in there and if he gets that it

0:15:10.329,0:15:16.359
kind of freaks out but what I do want to

0:15:13.809,0:15:18.699
do is I want to make him look like he's

0:15:16.359,0:15:22.749
walking right so I want him to look like

0:15:18.699,0:15:24.579
he's walking now this character there's

0:15:22.749,0:15:27.220
two ways you can do that this character

0:15:24.579,0:15:30.879
has looks or where you could change his

0:15:27.220,0:15:32.860
costume he also has animations that you

0:15:30.879,0:15:37.180
could run I'm going to choose

0:15:32.860,0:15:39.340
to use the animation this time and I'm

0:15:37.180,0:15:40.630
going to choose which animation I'd like

0:15:39.340,0:15:44.440
for him to do

0:15:40.630,0:15:49.360
I could choose for him to run it so now

0:15:44.440,0:15:51.220
he looks like he's running or I could

0:15:49.360,0:15:53.710
choose for him to walk it just depends

0:15:51.220,0:15:55.570
on what speed you kind of feel like your

0:15:53.710,0:15:58.510
monsters going at it doesn't really

0:15:55.570,0:15:59.920
matter what you choose also it's fun to

0:15:58.510,0:16:03.660
just look at different things let's just

0:15:59.920,0:16:03.660
kind of look at like his bite animation

0:16:03.720,0:16:08.460
there's have these things you could do

0:16:05.650,0:16:12.220
there right now I'm gonna leave it as

0:16:08.460,0:16:13.660
walked but I don't mind if you make your

0:16:12.220,0:16:17.980
games different than mine right it said

0:16:13.660,0:16:20.650
your monster I'm gonna leave mine as

0:16:17.980,0:16:22.690
walk or run doesn't matter but if you

0:16:20.650,0:16:24.760
wanted to use something different that's

0:16:22.690,0:16:28.450
fine with me now if you pick the

0:16:24.760,0:16:30.400
different type of actor let's say you

0:16:28.450,0:16:32.920
switched your monster you may not have

0:16:30.400,0:16:36.160
any animations and if that's the case

0:16:32.920,0:16:38.860
that's fine right alright so I think my

0:16:36.160,0:16:40.360
monster is doing pretty good so now I'm

0:16:38.860,0:16:41.800
gonna do one of the most important

0:16:40.360,0:16:42.730
things in software development does

0:16:41.800,0:16:44.230
anybody know what one of the most

0:16:42.730,0:16:47.500
important things in software development

0:16:44.230,0:16:49.660
is McKinley I'm gonna save my work I've

0:16:47.500,0:16:52.240
been typing forever but I'm gonna save

0:16:49.660,0:16:55.510
it now so up here at the top where it

0:16:52.240,0:16:59.230
says untitled I want you to type in the

0:16:55.510,0:17:02.770
title of this project will be I think a

0:16:59.230,0:17:04.270
good name is monster feast but again if

0:17:02.770,0:17:06.280
you want to call you something different

0:17:04.270,0:17:08.380
like maybe bow it will say Bowens a

0:17:06.280,0:17:09.910
monster feast or McKinley wants to say I

0:17:08.380,0:17:12.280
don't know McKinley's dinner

0:17:09.910,0:17:15.760
you can do whatever you want and then

0:17:12.280,0:17:18.220
you can click on save when you click on

0:17:15.760,0:17:20.260
save it's gonna ask you do you want to

0:17:18.220,0:17:23.080
just save it which is like local to be

0:17:20.260,0:17:26.110
or do you want to save and publish it

0:17:23.080,0:17:27.820
and publish means other people could see

0:17:26.110,0:17:30.430
it right now I'm just gonna click Save

0:17:27.820,0:17:33.010
you can also put in a description here

0:17:30.430,0:17:35.860
if you wanted you don't have to do this

0:17:33.010,0:17:38.320
at all right connecting with code day

0:17:35.860,0:17:42.220
one this is officially the week one camp

0:17:38.320,0:17:43.870
so I'm gonna click on save all right so

0:17:42.220,0:17:46.049
the next thing I want to do is right now

0:17:43.870,0:17:48.720
my monster is walking around

0:17:46.049,0:17:50.820
quickly white stage I think that we

0:17:48.720,0:17:52.110
could do better than white and so what

0:17:50.820,0:17:54.419
we want to do is we want to have him

0:17:52.110,0:17:56.850
walk around some background some

0:17:54.419,0:17:58.889
environment now the background is called

0:17:56.850,0:18:00.690
the stage so you notice that right now

0:17:58.889,0:18:02.759
you can click on stage or you can click

0:18:00.690,0:18:04.200
on actor when you click on the stage all

0:18:02.759,0:18:06.119
your code goes away that's not really

0:18:04.200,0:18:08.460
scary because it's actually just odd the

0:18:06.119,0:18:11.009
actor amount the stage by the way you

0:18:08.460,0:18:15.330
can also change the name of this guy he

0:18:11.009,0:18:17.039
is an actor and his name is actor that's

0:18:15.330,0:18:19.049
kind of a silly name for an actor it's

0:18:17.039,0:18:20.669
kind of like if you had a baby and you

0:18:19.049,0:18:22.320
decided to name your baby if you decided

0:18:20.669,0:18:24.210
how I'd be good name oh how about human

0:18:22.320,0:18:25.379
right this is my human date human all

0:18:24.210,0:18:26.609
right so I'm gonna change his name

0:18:25.379,0:18:30.629
instead of actor I'm gonna call him

0:18:26.609,0:18:32.460
monster now on the stage right now we

0:18:30.629,0:18:35.070
don't have any costumes so there's no

0:18:32.460,0:18:38.730
Edit pencil there's only a gear click on

0:18:35.070,0:18:40.019
this year after you click on that gear

0:18:38.730,0:18:42.359
you'll notice that there's things you

0:18:40.019,0:18:45.480
can do in sounds advanced or costumes we

0:18:42.359,0:18:48.869
want to add a background and what you

0:18:45.480,0:18:50.879
can do is you can pick a category and

0:18:48.869,0:18:53.609
then select the background that you

0:18:50.879,0:18:55.830
think would look good for you you could

0:18:53.609,0:18:57.600
pick any background you like I think

0:18:55.830,0:18:59.759
that Maya know it came from cookie gets

0:18:57.600,0:19:04.019
right here the kitchen so I'm gonna say

0:18:59.759,0:19:05.220
kitchen now I can add more backgrounds

0:19:04.019,0:19:07.859
if I wanted but I just need one

0:19:05.220,0:19:11.100
background something hit the X and so

0:19:07.859,0:19:14.730
now my game so I can walk around has a

0:19:11.100,0:19:16.590
kitchen just got a tea now what I want

0:19:14.730,0:19:19.139
to do in this kitchen is I want to

0:19:16.590,0:19:21.330
collect food so I'm gonna go around I'm

0:19:19.139,0:19:23.669
going to collect food and I'm gonna eat

0:19:21.330,0:19:26.429
it and then once I've collected enough

0:19:23.669,0:19:28.200
food it's gonna say you win now there's

0:19:26.429,0:19:30.059
no way to lose this game because it's

0:19:28.200,0:19:32.519
our first game I've done get more

0:19:30.059,0:19:34.289
complex don't worry but what we need to

0:19:32.519,0:19:36.179
do is we need to add another actor

0:19:34.289,0:19:39.830
that's got to be our food that we

0:19:36.179,0:19:42.659
collect so go and click on add actor

0:19:39.830,0:19:45.600
whenever you add an actor you could draw

0:19:42.659,0:19:48.239
it you could use one of their special

0:19:45.600,0:19:50.669
characters or you could use the media

0:19:48.239,0:19:52.379
library or you can upload your own write

0:19:50.669,0:19:57.269
some fun things there I'm gonna say

0:19:52.379,0:19:59.779
media library and what I'm gonna do is

0:19:57.269,0:20:02.570
I'm going to go looking around for

0:19:59.779,0:20:04.700
good image that might be fun for my

0:20:02.570,0:20:05.690
monster to eat I think cooking has a lot

0:20:04.700,0:20:08.659
of good things to eat

0:20:05.690,0:20:11.080
I could add like a cake or candy canes

0:20:08.659,0:20:13.460
or chocolate or whatever you'd like I

0:20:11.080,0:20:18.109
think when I find the most delicious are

0:20:13.460,0:20:23.629
cupcakes so I'm going to click on so now

0:20:18.109,0:20:26.649
I have a stage a monster and a cupcake

0:20:23.629,0:20:29.509
now I'm gonna rename my cupcake cupcake

0:20:26.649,0:20:32.749
waddlin now you'll see you later

0:20:29.509,0:20:35.179
whatever we have multiple cupcakes why I

0:20:32.749,0:20:36.950
named him cupcake one but it's cuz I'm

0:20:35.179,0:20:39.889
gonna have a 1 2 3 4 5 things you get

0:20:36.950,0:20:41.749
the idea and my cupcake has no code so

0:20:39.889,0:20:45.589
he's completely blank my monster eyes

0:20:41.749,0:20:47.719
code but my cupcake has done you'll also

0:20:45.589,0:20:50.779
notice that my cupcake is huge right if

0:20:47.719,0:20:54.469
your image came in huge what you can do

0:20:50.779,0:20:56.719
is you can grab a handle and you can put

0:20:54.469,0:20:58.159
it where you want and you can make it

0:20:56.719,0:21:00.619
the size you want maybe that's a good

0:20:58.159,0:21:03.379
sized cupcake for our monster I'm gonna

0:21:00.619,0:21:04.729
set it right up here on the table by the

0:21:03.379,0:21:06.679
way other things you can do is scratch

0:21:04.729,0:21:09.169
or take her just so you know is you can

0:21:06.679,0:21:11.149
click on there's like a tab up here at

0:21:09.169,0:21:13.339
the bot at the top you can see your

0:21:11.149,0:21:14.809
stage bigger that's not really that

0:21:13.339,0:21:16.669
useful if you're on a computer but if

0:21:14.809,0:21:19.609
you're on like an iPad that button is

0:21:16.669,0:21:21.109
very useful but you can also make your

0:21:19.609,0:21:22.909
stage bigger by clicking on this little

0:21:21.109,0:21:25.099
like expand everywhere and it makes it

0:21:22.909,0:21:28.099
bigger but just make sure you make it

0:21:25.099,0:21:29.929
smaller at some point all right so I've

0:21:28.099,0:21:31.519
got my cupcake sized about where I

0:21:29.929,0:21:33.589
wanted positioned about where I wanted

0:21:31.519,0:21:36.349
and I'm gonna start my monster kind of

0:21:33.589,0:21:37.969
down here in the corner now what I want

0:21:36.349,0:21:40.339
to do is I want to have code on my

0:21:37.969,0:21:43.999
cupcake as well so I click on my cupcake

0:21:40.339,0:21:47.419
I want to put in an on start for my

0:21:43.999,0:21:50.259
cupcake so I go up to events I find the

0:21:47.419,0:21:52.820
very first command which is on start and

0:21:50.259,0:21:55.639
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to tell

0:21:52.820,0:21:58.249
my cupcake to always check if the

0:21:55.639,0:21:59.539
monster's touching you so if you listen

0:21:58.249,0:22:02.509
to my words here you can figure out what

0:21:59.539,0:22:05.659
the code is always needs to do something

0:22:02.509,0:22:08.299
forever and check means if

0:22:05.659,0:22:11.989
statement.write will get better at these

0:22:08.299,0:22:13.570
things so first I go to control I go

0:22:11.989,0:22:17.420
it's find that forever

0:22:13.570,0:22:20.750
I'm going to say forever check to see if

0:22:17.420,0:22:22.670
they're touching a monster and so check

0:22:20.750,0:22:25.330
is an if statement so I'm gonna go and

0:22:22.670,0:22:27.680
grab the if statement and bring it in

0:22:25.330,0:22:30.080
now the if statements that I brought in

0:22:27.680,0:22:32.900
it says if false then we're really false

0:22:30.080,0:22:36.800
is just a place over it says if this

0:22:32.900,0:22:38.840
condition happens then we run this code

0:22:36.800,0:22:41.420
that's kind of the idea of how it works

0:22:38.840,0:22:43.850
so the condition that I want here is I

0:22:41.420,0:22:46.730
wanted it since whether I'm touching the

0:22:43.850,0:22:48.620
monster or not and I cheated I said the

0:22:46.730,0:22:51.440
key word in there this is a command

0:22:48.620,0:22:54.950
that's in the sensing category so click

0:22:51.440,0:22:56.360
on the sensing category and what I want

0:22:54.950,0:23:01.670
to do is I want to find the command that

0:22:56.360,0:23:04.190
says mi touching the monster now it

0:23:01.670,0:23:06.350
turns out that there is no command that

0:23:04.190,0:23:09.260
says touching monster the one that you

0:23:06.350,0:23:10.400
want is touching mouse pointer and

0:23:09.260,0:23:12.230
you're like well that's kind of weird

0:23:10.400,0:23:13.820
because I don't care about if I'm

0:23:12.230,0:23:15.400
touching your mouse pointer I care about

0:23:13.820,0:23:18.230
if I'm touching the monster

0:23:15.400,0:23:20.809
well this command has one of those boxes

0:23:18.230,0:23:23.690
that you can change right and I want to

0:23:20.809,0:23:28.340
change this box to say if touching

0:23:23.690,0:23:32.090
monster so if I'm touching the monster

0:23:28.340,0:23:34.220
then I want to do something the thing I

0:23:32.090,0:23:38.390
want to do is I want to hide I want my

0:23:34.220,0:23:40.670
cupcake to hide to disappear hide is it

0:23:38.390,0:23:43.610
looks so you got to go to the looks

0:23:40.670,0:23:44.990
category don't worry you looking good

0:23:43.610,0:23:48.890
about switching back and forth between

0:23:44.990,0:23:52.550
categories in the side of looks you'll

0:23:48.890,0:23:53.690
have to scroll to ear the bottom near

0:23:52.550,0:23:56.480
the bottom there's an area called

0:23:53.690,0:24:00.100
visibility and I want to do two things

0:23:56.480,0:24:04.160
if I touch the monster I want to hide

0:24:00.100,0:24:05.570
and now I'll warn you if you were to

0:24:04.160,0:24:06.950
play your game right now it would hide

0:24:05.570,0:24:08.990
your cupcake and that it would just be

0:24:06.950,0:24:14.630
gone forever right so you actually want

0:24:08.990,0:24:17.150
to actually show it initially so I added

0:24:14.630,0:24:19.040
two things there I added window I want

0:24:17.150,0:24:22.820
to show it and window I want to hide it

0:24:19.040,0:24:25.190
I want to show it on starters and then

0:24:22.820,0:24:27.370
if I'm ever touching the monster that I

0:24:25.190,0:24:29.980
want to hide it

0:24:27.370,0:24:31.960
now one thing I like to do with code is

0:24:29.980,0:24:34.480
I've got enough code here that I could

0:24:31.960,0:24:37.030
test it and so what I want to do is my

0:24:34.480,0:24:39.550
games not done I know it's not done but

0:24:37.030,0:24:42.670
I wouldn't test it and see if I really

0:24:39.550,0:24:44.650
do hide I would I touch the monster so

0:24:42.670,0:24:48.760
I'm gonna test my code so I'm gonna run

0:24:44.650,0:24:51.220
it my lobster is kind of like ambling

0:24:48.760,0:24:52.780
all here following my mouse pointer if

0:24:51.220,0:24:55.870
he gets to my mouse pointer he does kind

0:24:52.780,0:24:58.390
of freak out feature and if he touches

0:24:55.870,0:24:58.840
the cupcake the cupcake successfully

0:24:58.390,0:25:01.059
hides

0:24:58.840,0:25:03.880
now after a hide is kind of like well

0:25:01.059,0:25:05.920
one now what I do right well you can

0:25:03.880,0:25:08.080
stop your game and you can hit play

0:25:05.920,0:25:10.500
again and you can play it again but

0:25:08.080,0:25:13.120
there's no way to win your game really

0:25:10.500,0:25:16.630
but you can make that cupcake hide which

0:25:13.120,0:25:19.450
is good so we'd like to do a good time

0:25:16.630,0:25:22.840
to save by the way click on save saving

0:25:19.450,0:25:24.670
saved so what we'd like to do is we'd

0:25:22.840,0:25:26.980
like to make it to where you can collect

0:25:24.670,0:25:29.200
like five cupcakes or some number of

0:25:26.980,0:25:31.330
cupcakes and then you win the game hey

0:25:29.200,0:25:33.520
also just because it bothers me right

0:25:31.330,0:25:35.320
now my cupcake is gone right wait why is

0:25:33.520,0:25:37.420
my cupcake gone and it's gone because

0:25:35.320,0:25:38.830
the last thing it did was hide and so

0:25:37.420,0:25:40.420
what I want to do this is this is a

0:25:38.830,0:25:43.330
little trick I'm going to start my game

0:25:40.420,0:25:45.040
and stop it almost immediately and that

0:25:43.330,0:25:48.250
way the last thing my cupcake did was a

0:25:45.040,0:25:50.140
show so now I can kind of see it you

0:25:48.250,0:25:52.330
don't have to do that but I like to see

0:25:50.140,0:25:55.600
it as I'm doing my development so what I

0:25:52.330,0:25:59.260
want to do is I want to keep track of

0:25:55.600,0:26:01.179
how many cupcakes Ivy does anybody have

0:25:59.260,0:26:03.360
any ideas for how we would keep track of

0:26:01.179,0:26:06.700
something

0:26:03.360,0:26:09.970
McKinley variables yeah so we want to

0:26:06.700,0:26:11.650
keep track of how many what would you do

0:26:09.970,0:26:13.870
that we want to keep track of how many

0:26:11.650,0:26:17.980
cupcakes we beat so I'm going to go into

0:26:13.870,0:26:20.230
a new area called variables inside

0:26:17.980,0:26:26.559
variables I'm going to create a variable

0:26:20.230,0:26:28.360
so click on create variable you can name

0:26:26.559,0:26:30.970
this variable whatever you would like

0:26:28.360,0:26:32.650
I'm gonna call it food because I don't

0:26:30.970,0:26:33.820
know what you've got maybe you've got

0:26:32.650,0:26:35.260
cupcakes maybe we've got something

0:26:33.820,0:26:36.670
that's not food who knows what your

0:26:35.260,0:26:38.100
monster likes to eat maybe he likes to

0:26:36.670,0:26:39.900
eat ten cans

0:26:38.100,0:26:42.059
and then you've got it aside this is

0:26:39.900,0:26:45.600
kind of an advanced question do I want

0:26:42.059,0:26:48.059
this variable for all actors or for this

0:26:45.600,0:26:50.010
actor only well all the actors are going

0:26:48.059,0:26:52.650
to share this variable so what's called

0:26:50.010,0:26:55.910
a global variable everybody shares it so

0:26:52.650,0:27:02.100
I want to say food is for all actors

0:26:55.910,0:27:05.400
great so create it now I've got this

0:27:02.100,0:27:08.220
variable food and I can run my game and

0:27:05.400,0:27:10.440
I've got a variable food it's inside my

0:27:08.220,0:27:13.409
computer somewhere but I'm not using it

0:27:10.440,0:27:15.929
any interesting way I also can't see the

0:27:13.409,0:27:17.669
value anywhere right so that I have no

0:27:15.929,0:27:18.960
idea what this variable is now they've

0:27:17.669,0:27:20.460
got a feature for this because we're

0:27:18.960,0:27:22.200
getting started with variables they've

0:27:20.460,0:27:24.390
got a feature that lets you see the

0:27:22.200,0:27:26.610
variable like see it's either under the

0:27:24.390,0:27:30.539
hood here's how you see it it's called a

0:27:26.610,0:27:32.640
watcher so click on food and then

0:27:30.539,0:27:34.650
there's a new command that pops up

0:27:32.640,0:27:36.750
called add watcher I click this button

0:27:34.650,0:27:40.169
and then kind of watch what happens I

0:27:36.750,0:27:43.250
click this button and what it did it's

0:27:40.169,0:27:47.760
kind of sneaky is it added another actor

0:27:43.250,0:27:50.640
this actor is a little green box just

0:27:47.760,0:27:53.039
kind of weird and this actor doesn't

0:27:50.640,0:27:55.559
really like participate in the game he

0:27:53.039,0:27:58.320
just shows you the value of the variable

0:27:55.559,0:27:59.760
food now he is actually an actor just

0:27:58.320,0:28:02.070
like everything else is an actor he has

0:27:59.760,0:28:04.110
code just like the mob stress code and

0:28:02.070,0:28:06.210
the cupcake has code and this guy has

0:28:04.110,0:28:08.190
code and interestingly this is

0:28:06.210,0:28:09.390
unfortunate there is a bug in his code

0:28:08.190,0:28:12.059
sorry

0:28:09.390,0:28:14.580
the auto generated code has a bug in it

0:28:12.059,0:28:16.890
yes everyone makes mistakes here's what

0:28:14.580,0:28:21.809
you've got to do you've got to find this

0:28:16.890,0:28:24.059
bug the bug is where it says property

0:28:21.809,0:28:26.940
food of company by the way it's good to

0:28:24.059,0:28:29.549
get better at using your tools so you

0:28:26.940,0:28:32.480
can zoom way out and you can see like

0:28:29.549,0:28:35.159
the whole thing or you can zoom way in

0:28:32.480,0:28:37.049
you can also just grab the black area

0:28:35.159,0:28:38.610
and kind of like move over this way but

0:28:37.049,0:28:41.090
it's good to get better at brew the

0:28:38.610,0:28:43.559
route and the bug is kind of silly

0:28:41.090,0:28:48.020
property food of cupcake it shouldn't

0:28:43.559,0:28:48.020
say cupcake here we should say of any I

0:28:48.320,0:28:53.170
could have left you see that bug later

0:28:51.370,0:28:55.420
that's a volunteer coup that wasn't even

0:28:53.170,0:28:57.630
your fault so let's go back to our

0:28:55.420,0:29:02.020
monster now we fixed our little bug and

0:28:57.630,0:29:04.660
let's set the variable food and see it

0:29:02.020,0:29:07.090
show up up here so to set the variable

0:29:04.660,0:29:09.610
food I'm gonna go I'm still variables

0:29:07.090,0:29:12.760
I'm gonna take the third command which

0:29:09.610,0:29:19.870
is a set and it's the very very first

0:29:12.760,0:29:24.370
thing I'm gonna set food to be zero now

0:29:19.870,0:29:25.810
you could choose to count up but so this

0:29:24.370,0:29:26.800
time I'm going to count up at my other

0:29:25.810,0:29:28.900
example I counted down

0:29:26.800,0:29:31.420
you can count up or down it's up to you

0:29:28.900,0:29:33.220
but I'm gonna start food off a zero and

0:29:31.420,0:29:36.610
you'll notice if you look at my stage

0:29:33.220,0:29:38.380
that it shows food right there now what

0:29:36.610,0:29:44.440
I want to happen is whatever I collect a

0:29:38.380,0:29:48.910
cupcake I want food to go up by one so

0:29:44.440,0:29:51.640
we can do that so let's go back to our

0:29:48.910,0:29:53.230
cupcake so whenever you make a game

0:29:51.640,0:29:55.300
you've got all these actors that

0:29:53.230,0:29:58.860
interact at the interest place and when

0:29:55.300,0:30:01.780
the cupcake hides I want him to also

0:29:58.860,0:30:04.300
change that variable so I'm in my

0:30:01.780,0:30:07.330
cupcake as I clicked on my cupcake I see

0:30:04.300,0:30:10.570
my cupcake code right here and for this

0:30:07.330,0:30:17.160
cupcake I'm gonna change the variable so

0:30:10.570,0:30:20.620
I'm in variables and I say change by and

0:30:17.160,0:30:23.410
I'm gonna put this either right below

0:30:20.620,0:30:25.510
hide or right above hide it doesn't

0:30:23.410,0:30:26.740
matter as long as it's inside this if

0:30:25.510,0:30:29.770
statement somewhere that's all that

0:30:26.740,0:30:34.060
really matters but I want to change food

0:30:29.770,0:30:35.860
by one now if you would prefer to count

0:30:34.060,0:30:37.330
down you could you could say change food

0:30:35.860,0:30:40.000
by negative one I'm just gonna count up

0:30:37.330,0:30:42.930
I'm gonna keep it simple and so now when

0:30:40.000,0:30:47.140
I run it you'll notice that food is zero

0:30:42.930,0:30:51.700
and as soon as I grab that cupcake food

0:30:47.140,0:30:56.380
change to one pretty cool now I want a

0:30:51.700,0:30:57.670
bunch of food probably a good time to

0:30:56.380,0:31:01.570
save by the way I'm gonna go and click

0:30:57.670,0:31:03.650
on save again but I want a bunch of food

0:31:01.570,0:31:05.300
so that I can collect lots of

0:31:03.650,0:31:08.120
lots of food and then as soon as I get

0:31:05.300,0:31:10.340
like all the food that I know that I'd

0:31:08.120,0:31:13.220
want so let's go ahead and make more

0:31:10.340,0:31:14.840
cupcakes so the first thing I want to do

0:31:13.220,0:31:16.430
all my cupcakes invisible again I know

0:31:14.840,0:31:18.620
this trick it's because the last thing

0:31:16.430,0:31:21.080
he did was hide if I hit play and stop

0:31:18.620,0:31:23.240
then he'll show up then the last thing

0:31:21.080,0:31:25.670
he did was show up right now I'm going

0:31:23.240,0:31:28.150
to duplicate it so to duplicate it I'm

0:31:25.670,0:31:32.960
gonna click on these three dots and

0:31:28.150,0:31:34.460
select duplicate and tinkers nice to you

0:31:32.960,0:31:37.430
it kind of moves it a little bit but I'm

0:31:34.460,0:31:38.510
gonna move it somewhere different and

0:31:37.430,0:31:40.940
then I'm gonna select on this one I'm

0:31:38.510,0:31:44.990
gonna say duplicate again but I've got

0:31:40.940,0:31:46.430
two and you can choose to make as many

0:31:44.990,0:31:49.370
as you would like I know there's a

0:31:46.430,0:31:50.930
temptation to make like thousand but I

0:31:49.370,0:31:53.510
recommend you only make like I don't

0:31:50.930,0:31:56.530
know four or five Raziel I also

0:31:53.510,0:31:59.420
recommend that you move them somewhere

0:31:56.530,0:32:02.060
that isn't like directly in front of

0:31:59.420,0:32:03.590
your monster right I saw like I wouldn't

0:32:02.060,0:32:05.210
want to put the cupcakes like right here

0:32:03.590,0:32:06.800
because then I would start my game and

0:32:05.210,0:32:08.240
he would just get that one right so I'm

0:32:06.800,0:32:12.920
gonna move them kind of far away from

0:32:08.240,0:32:17.570
where he starts at cool so now I've got

0:32:12.920,0:32:20.960
five cupcakes now their names were kind

0:32:17.570,0:32:27.110
of ridiculous their names are like 11

0:32:20.960,0:32:33.770
and 111111 I'm gonna change all those

0:32:27.110,0:32:36.950
names just to be 1 2 3 4 5 that is

0:32:33.770,0:32:40.490
optional it's just if you if you want to

0:32:36.950,0:32:44.030
you could make that happen now let's see

0:32:40.490,0:32:46.310
if when we collect a cupcake so there

0:32:44.030,0:32:50.920
I've collected one and my variable isn't

0:32:46.310,0:32:53.180
one if I collect two my variables at two

0:32:50.920,0:32:58.730
and I'm going to keep going until I get

0:32:53.180,0:33:03.800
them all three and then four and then

0:32:58.730,0:33:08.510
five cool so my game totally worked

0:33:03.800,0:33:10.970
I won my game I collected all the

0:33:08.510,0:33:13.130
cupcakes but I really don't feel very

0:33:10.970,0:33:13.980
satisfied because he's just still

0:33:13.130,0:33:16.590
walking away

0:33:13.980,0:33:21.299
right so what I would like to do is I

0:33:16.590,0:33:24.360
would like to tell my user you know you

0:33:21.299,0:33:26.159
win good job and I would like to stop

0:33:24.360,0:33:29.159
the game right because the game has been

0:33:26.159,0:33:35.580
won so let's see if we can go do those

0:33:29.159,0:33:37.260
things so back to your monster so your

0:33:35.580,0:33:39.750
monster is kind of like the main

0:33:37.260,0:33:41.519
character in your game so code that

0:33:39.750,0:33:43.649
that's like important goes on your

0:33:41.519,0:33:44.850
monster right and so here's what I want

0:33:43.649,0:33:48.950
to do with my monster

0:33:44.850,0:33:53.039
I want my monster to always check if

0:33:48.950,0:33:54.600
food the variable is equal to five in my

0:33:53.039,0:33:58.260
case because I have five pieces of food

0:33:54.600,0:34:01.820
so I said check so I know that I needed

0:33:58.260,0:34:05.429
if statement so I'm gonna go to control

0:34:01.820,0:34:08.399
inside control I've got to add an if

0:34:05.429,0:34:10.649
statement it can go wherever you would

0:34:08.399,0:34:12.750
like inside your monsters forever loop

0:34:10.649,0:34:16.290
I'm gonna put it at the bottom just goes

0:34:12.750,0:34:19.560
as well I feel like it and so if some

0:34:16.290,0:34:21.540
condition happens then from this code

0:34:19.560,0:34:25.889
the condition that we're looking for is

0:34:21.540,0:34:27.030
does the variable food equal five so I

0:34:25.889,0:34:31.310
got to find what goes into this

0:34:27.030,0:34:37.139
condition it's in operators inside

0:34:31.310,0:34:39.060
operators look for an equals side the

0:34:37.139,0:34:42.659
equal sign it's the second one down in

0:34:39.060,0:34:44.159
boolean and you'll notice that if you

0:34:42.659,0:34:46.829
look at the equal sign but it's kind of

0:34:44.159,0:34:50.129
shaped like a little hexagon diamond

0:34:46.829,0:34:54.089
thing and so that is a cue for you that

0:34:50.129,0:34:56.069
it goes into a condition like this and

0:34:54.089,0:34:59.430
now what I want to say here is I want to

0:34:56.069,0:35:03.210
say if food equals five so I've got to

0:34:59.430,0:35:05.940
go to variables I've gotta find by food

0:35:03.210,0:35:09.720
variable so here's my food variable I'm

0:35:05.940,0:35:14.180
gonna drag it into the left hand side if

0:35:09.720,0:35:17.970
food equals five

0:35:14.180,0:35:22.050
then you've just won and you need to say

0:35:17.970,0:35:24.990
you win right so inside the if statement

0:35:22.050,0:35:26.670
I want to say you win now interestingly

0:35:24.990,0:35:27.230
what we're going to say is we're gonna

0:35:26.670,0:35:29.690
say it with

0:35:27.230,0:35:33.800
speech bubble you win so that's actually

0:35:29.690,0:35:36.710
it looks scroll to the scariest Lincoln

0:35:33.800,0:35:39.530
command you can find it looks this one

0:35:36.710,0:35:41.930
is super scary so this one that says say

0:35:39.530,0:35:45.290
hello and then there's like a - an

0:35:41.930,0:35:47.359
applause for two seconds that's the one

0:35:45.290,0:35:50.300
you want now we could use one of these

0:35:47.359,0:35:51.859
not scary ones like say hub for two

0:35:50.300,0:35:54.140
seconds or something like that but the

0:35:51.859,0:35:57.020
scary one I actually want all these

0:35:54.140,0:35:59.780
options right so yeah we're starting

0:35:57.020,0:36:01.310
with the world's scariest man so let's

0:35:59.780,0:36:03.619
look at this super scary command a

0:36:01.310,0:36:06.380
little bit the most important part is

0:36:03.619,0:36:10.130
what he says so right now he says hello

0:36:06.380,0:36:12.080
you can decide what you wanted to say I

0:36:10.130,0:36:15.080
could hear one of my campers over there

0:36:12.080,0:36:18.890
it is says you win

0:36:15.080,0:36:24.680
good job mode I'm going to say you win

0:36:18.890,0:36:27.350
good job Dave now when you win you've

0:36:24.680,0:36:30.590
got all kinds of options in this textbox

0:36:27.350,0:36:33.140
you could leave the defaults and just

0:36:30.590,0:36:35.210
not worry about it the defaults give you

0:36:33.140,0:36:36.920
a bottom message box which I think looks

0:36:35.210,0:36:39.200
pretty good if you wanted to leave that

0:36:36.920,0:36:41.240
but you could do different things you

0:36:39.200,0:36:42.890
could have like your actor could say it

0:36:41.240,0:36:45.440
I think it could be like a speech bubble

0:36:42.890,0:36:48.020
from your actor you could change the

0:36:45.440,0:36:50.930
font you can do about whatever you want

0:36:48.020,0:36:53.420
what I'm gonna do not because it matters

0:36:50.930,0:36:56.480
is I'm gonna pick a speech bubble or

0:36:53.420,0:36:58.910
rectangular speech bubble and I'm gonna

0:36:56.480,0:37:04.430
make the font quite a bit bigger I'm

0:36:58.910,0:37:08.900
gonna make the font a 48 font so let's

0:37:04.430,0:37:12.260
try it so I hit play I start collecting

0:37:08.900,0:37:13.970
cupcakes now one thing you might notice

0:37:12.260,0:37:17.270
is that your monster is just a little on

0:37:13.970,0:37:21.470
the slow side I bet something you can

0:37:17.270,0:37:23.210
fix but it totally works it totally

0:37:21.470,0:37:25.369
works but it totally has one little

0:37:23.210,0:37:27.680
feature I don't like and that's after I

0:37:25.369,0:37:31.160
get the last one it worked

0:37:27.680,0:37:33.290
it said you win good job Dave but then

0:37:31.160,0:37:34.810
the game kind of keeps playing it kind

0:37:33.290,0:37:37.960
of an awkward

0:37:34.810,0:37:39.880
so the game is over and so what I want

0:37:37.960,0:37:41.410
to do and you can choose what you want

0:37:39.880,0:37:44.040
to do I want I just want the game to

0:37:41.410,0:37:48.370
stop right that's not be enough for me

0:37:44.040,0:37:49.510
so after I say you win good job Dave I

0:37:48.370,0:37:53.980
want the game to stop

0:37:49.510,0:37:57.600
that's it control it's the very last

0:37:53.980,0:38:01.420
command and control that says stop all

0:37:57.600,0:38:06.490
so stop all we want to put immediately

0:38:01.420,0:38:08.590
after that big scary command so say you

0:38:06.490,0:38:11.140
would good job Dave and then stop all

0:38:08.590,0:38:14.500
now it's very important that this stop

0:38:11.140,0:38:16.300
all is inside of the if statement so I

0:38:14.500,0:38:18.940
can click on like this handle and I can

0:38:16.300,0:38:21.460
see that it is it back inside of it now

0:38:18.940,0:38:23.080
you can run yours like that but I'm

0:38:21.460,0:38:25.630
going to show you a mistake just to kind

0:38:23.080,0:38:28.690
of show it to you let's say that I was

0:38:25.630,0:38:32.080
not paying very good attention let's say

0:38:28.690,0:38:34.690
that I put my stop all come in right

0:38:32.080,0:38:38.200
here you're like oh that looks about the

0:38:34.690,0:38:41.800
same it's not and the reason it's not is

0:38:38.200,0:38:43.300
because the if statements only has the

0:38:41.800,0:38:46.720
say in it

0:38:43.300,0:38:49.600
and the stop all is actually just inside

0:38:46.720,0:38:51.880
the forever right so it's not inside of

0:38:49.600,0:38:55.960
it so now what happens is if I run my

0:38:51.880,0:38:58.210
game he just stops immediately right and

0:38:55.960,0:39:00.910
it that's what's called a bug they can

0:38:58.210,0:39:03.190
be very hard to find there are some

0:39:00.910,0:39:05.110
tools and Taker that trying to help you

0:39:03.190,0:39:05.560
find bugs it's called this little bug

0:39:05.110,0:39:08.530
icon

0:39:05.560,0:39:10.870
sometimes that bug icon is useful I can

0:39:08.530,0:39:13.060
show you like where things are going

0:39:10.870,0:39:15.310
wrong I don't know if I really use that

0:39:13.060,0:39:18.010
bug that much but it's there but just

0:39:15.310,0:39:21.250
know that everybody makes bugs buttons

0:39:18.010,0:39:22.840
are a part of coding and the way we plan

0:39:21.250,0:39:25.690
to help you with bugs is we have zoom

0:39:22.840,0:39:27.010
meetings so if you go to our camp page

0:39:25.690,0:39:30.100
which you hopefully saw the email

0:39:27.010,0:39:32.770
there's rules home and students that can

0:39:30.100,0:39:35.470
help you with bugs and so if you have a

0:39:32.770,0:39:36.880
bug that you need help with rules hoping

0:39:35.470,0:39:38.770
students will be at those zoom meetings

0:39:36.880,0:39:41.940
to help you out so I'm gonna get my last

0:39:38.770,0:39:44.869
one and it says you win good job Dave

0:39:41.940,0:39:47.160
so I think that I have a finished game

0:39:44.869,0:39:48.839
after I play a game if I want to play

0:39:47.160,0:39:52.260
again I just have to hit start and stop

0:39:48.839,0:39:53.760
I think that I have a finished game so

0:39:52.260,0:39:56.640
I'm going to go ahead and publish mine

0:39:53.760,0:39:59.430
so other people can see it there are

0:39:56.640,0:40:01.020
some extras that you can add I'll just

0:39:59.430,0:40:03.599
kind of mentioned some of those extras

0:40:01.020,0:40:04.980
if you'd like to add extras but first

0:40:03.599,0:40:06.839
I'm going to go ahead and publish mine

0:40:04.980,0:40:09.420
so I'm gonna stick on this down arrow

0:40:06.839,0:40:12.720
next to save I'm gonna say publish to

0:40:09.420,0:40:13.410
community so this is monsterpiece maybe

0:40:12.720,0:40:17.280
I'll call it

0:40:13.410,0:40:21.119
Dave's monster feast and I'll say save

0:40:17.280,0:40:24.420
and publish now with your games I do

0:40:21.119,0:40:26.280
recommend that you add little extras so

0:40:24.420,0:40:29.250
for example a little extra here might be

0:40:26.280,0:40:32.460
that I could make him go faster than Ted

0:40:29.250,0:40:34.289
like maybe I want him to go in 20 or an

0:40:32.460,0:40:35.970
even more advanced little extra you

0:40:34.289,0:40:41.599
don't have to do this just saying you

0:40:35.970,0:40:41.599
couldn't make a variable called speed

0:40:42.710,0:40:46.440
and that variable speed you don't have

0:40:45.119,0:40:49.559
to do this you just watch it that

0:40:46.440,0:40:55.200
variable speed could start off at like

0:40:49.559,0:40:57.390
10 and I could use that variable speed

0:40:55.200,0:41:00.240
I'm doing this fast for this optional

0:40:57.390,0:41:04.319
and then my other cupcakes could change

0:41:00.240,0:41:06.839
speed in addition to changing food and

0:41:04.319,0:41:11.760
then I would get faster right so maybe

0:41:06.839,0:41:13.319
they'll make speed go up so I only put

0:41:11.760,0:41:15.390
this on one cupcake but right now my

0:41:13.319,0:41:17.339
speed is kind of a slow speed but as

0:41:15.390,0:41:20.010
soon as I get that cupcake on I'm going

0:41:17.339,0:41:23.160
fast so there's all kinds of extras that

0:41:20.010,0:41:26.130
you could add to your game this camp day

0:41:23.160,0:41:28.859
there's also if you would like a whole

0:41:26.130,0:41:31.200
extra assignment a whole extra video

0:41:28.859,0:41:33.660
it's called scorekeeper if you would

0:41:31.200,0:41:36.210
like to do extra go watch that video

0:41:33.660,0:41:37.770
that's totally fine but keep in mind

0:41:36.210,0:41:40.049
that it's not really part of the camp

0:41:37.770,0:41:41.490
day it is in fact just an extra so I'm

0:41:40.049,0:41:43.289
not gonna have my campers join me for

0:41:41.490,0:41:45.119
that I'm just gonna give extra thanks

0:41:43.289,0:41:46.740
for the people to watch now the main

0:41:45.119,0:41:50.190
thing that I want to do today is I want

0:41:46.740,0:41:52.020
