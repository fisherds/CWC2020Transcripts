[Music]

0:00:04.130,0:00:09.300
hey welcome back you've made it to the

0:00:06.899,0:00:11.040
end today is the last day so I'm here

0:00:09.300,0:00:13.769
with my campers again better go ahead

0:00:11.040,0:00:15.630
and introduce them so we've got Keegan

0:00:13.769,0:00:18.900
of course where'd his camp t-shirt by

0:00:15.630,0:00:23.519
the way mom and Bowen and McKinley you

0:00:18.900,0:00:25.380
guys really good today all right so what

0:00:23.519,0:00:28.410
we have to do today so today what we're

0:00:25.380,0:00:31.260
making is a game called dragon crossing

0:00:28.410,0:00:31.830
so I think dragon crossing is best to

0:00:31.260,0:00:33.660
show you

0:00:31.830,0:00:35.430
I think that's nothing's work best so

0:00:33.660,0:00:39.270
with dragon crossing what we're gonna do

0:00:35.430,0:00:41.219
is we're going to try to get our dragon

0:00:39.270,0:00:43.140
across the street right it's our dragon

0:00:41.219,0:00:45.300
can kind of go up and down and he can

0:00:43.140,0:00:48.329
try to get to the street get to the top

0:00:45.300,0:00:50.160
ah and if you touch a car you lose but

0:00:48.329,0:00:51.510
it just lets you play again now you'll

0:00:50.160,0:00:52.710
notice that whenever I did this play

0:00:51.510,0:00:54.829
again that everybody just kind of

0:00:52.710,0:00:59.399
stopped oh no I'm in trouble

0:00:54.829,0:01:00.600
yes oh I got hit so close you'll notice

0:00:59.399,0:01:02.309
that everybody just kind of stops

0:01:00.600,0:01:03.930
whenever there's a win or a loss happens

0:01:02.309,0:01:06.270
and one of the things we're going to be

0:01:03.930,0:01:07.850
doing today there was a win one of the

0:01:06.270,0:01:09.630
things we're gonna be doing today is

0:01:07.850,0:01:13.020
communicating between our different

0:01:09.630,0:01:15.750
actors so this like very coordinated hey

0:01:13.020,0:01:18.750
everybody stop at the same time all

0:01:15.750,0:01:21.000
right now is something that we have to

0:01:18.750,0:01:22.830
figure out in code how to do and make

0:01:21.000,0:01:24.600
happen

0:01:22.830,0:01:25.860
also I mentioned that your theme can be

0:01:24.600,0:01:28.140
different from mine so I've got her

0:01:25.860,0:01:31.170
dragon crossing a road but really it

0:01:28.140,0:01:33.329
just has to be a hero with enemies that

0:01:31.170,0:01:34.590
move back and forth and then a victory

0:01:33.329,0:01:37.049
at the top so if you wanted to do like

0:01:34.590,0:01:38.700
planets or something crazy with

0:01:37.049,0:01:41.430
something different color at the top you

0:01:38.700,0:01:43.560
could totally I do different things so

0:01:41.430,0:01:46.710
let's go and see if we can get started

0:01:43.560,0:01:48.659
today so I'm gonna go ahead and make a

0:01:46.710,0:01:50.790
new project so I'm going to say create

0:01:48.659,0:01:53.250
new project hopefully we're pretty good

0:01:50.790,0:01:55.920
on the step every single time I go down

0:01:53.250,0:01:57.540
to block coding project but I'm really

0:01:55.920,0:01:58.680
sure that they are the same so today I'm

0:01:57.540,0:02:02.369
going to risk I'm just gonna go with

0:01:58.680,0:02:05.820
blank project and let's go ahead and get

0:02:02.369,0:02:07.049
started with drawing some things so the

0:02:05.820,0:02:09.929
first thing I'll do is that I don't

0:02:07.049,0:02:12.989
actually need my actor my monster so I'm

0:02:09.929,0:02:14.130
going to delete him and we've got to

0:02:12.989,0:02:16.780
draw a stay

0:02:14.130,0:02:18.190
our stage has to have whatever we want

0:02:16.780,0:02:20.770
in the middle I'm gonna draw like a road

0:02:18.190,0:02:23.140
scene it has to have a victory color at

0:02:20.770,0:02:24.850
the top for your victory color it's nice

0:02:23.140,0:02:26.050
to go and have a pencil and paper handy

0:02:24.850,0:02:28.570
so that you can write down what your

0:02:26.050,0:02:31.600
victory color is and then we're also

0:02:28.570,0:02:33.460
gonna need to make four different like

0:02:31.600,0:02:36.730
enemies so let's go ahead and start off

0:02:33.460,0:02:40.590
by drawing some so click on the gear for

0:02:36.730,0:02:42.880
the stage click on add backgrounds and

0:02:40.590,0:02:45.370
then like we've done so many times we're

0:02:42.880,0:02:46.660
going to draw an image and you kind of

0:02:45.370,0:02:47.800
have to click on that twice after click

0:02:46.660,0:02:50.830
on the paintbrush and then the draw

0:02:47.800,0:02:53.620
lemon first thing I like to do is I like

0:02:50.830,0:02:56.920
to make my stage fit on my entire screen

0:02:53.620,0:03:00.190
so I know I can see everything and I'm

0:02:56.920,0:03:01.720
gonna choose to make like a green grass

0:03:00.190,0:03:03.910
first it's almost like I'm building a

0:03:01.720,0:03:07.360
road so first there's grass and then I'm

0:03:03.910,0:03:09.670
gonna put a road on top of it so to make

0:03:07.360,0:03:12.940
some green grass I'm gonna pick a color

0:03:09.670,0:03:14.620
a nice green here and use my paintbrush

0:03:12.940,0:03:17.260
tool and I'm just gonna fill it in all

0:03:14.620,0:03:19.360
green after that I'm going to draw my

0:03:17.260,0:03:21.459
road and again you can draw something

0:03:19.360,0:03:23.020
different if you want you can draw up my

0:03:21.459,0:03:24.160
pace you can draw at your own pace

0:03:23.020,0:03:27.880
it doesn't really matter but I'm gonna

0:03:24.160,0:03:29.530
draw a grey road as a rectangle I'm

0:03:27.880,0:03:31.300
gonna pick one of these Gray's and I'm

0:03:29.530,0:03:33.550
gonna try to make it such that it takes

0:03:31.300,0:03:36.760
up most of the space but leave some

0:03:33.550,0:03:38.230
space at the bottom to where my hero can

0:03:36.760,0:03:40.390
kind of like start off not just getting

0:03:38.230,0:03:43.240
killed right out of the gate right so

0:03:40.390,0:03:44.680
there's a nice big rectangle also if you

0:03:43.240,0:03:46.060
draw it it's not where you want it

0:03:44.680,0:03:48.100
remember that you can always kind of

0:03:46.060,0:03:51.610
grab these handles and if it goes really

0:03:48.100,0:03:52.959
badly the undo button is useful I next

0:03:51.610,0:03:56.470
thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna draw

0:03:52.959,0:04:00.220
some white lines on my room so if I

0:03:56.470,0:04:03.340
wanted to draw some white lines draw it

0:04:00.220,0:04:04.810
here and then move it and you can draw

0:04:03.340,0:04:06.160
it you know like slightly on the road

0:04:04.810,0:04:09.280
slightly off the road it doesn't really

0:04:06.160,0:04:12.040
matter another trick to keep in mind is

0:04:09.280,0:04:14.860
that before you drop it if you want to

0:04:12.040,0:04:16.750
be like a pro drawler you can copy/paste

0:04:14.860,0:04:18.940
things and copy paste I think it saves a

0:04:16.750,0:04:22.390
lot of time today if you get good at

0:04:18.940,0:04:24.780
copy paste so I chose to hit ctrl C and

0:04:22.390,0:04:26.560
then control V to kind of copy paste it

0:04:24.780,0:04:27.730
next thing I'm going to do is I'm going

0:04:26.560,0:04:29.710
to draw a bunch of law

0:04:27.730,0:04:33.310
on my road I'm gonna have like a

0:04:29.710,0:04:36.280
four-lane highway as my goal so what I'm

0:04:33.310,0:04:40.090
gonna do is I'm gonna draw a nice yellow

0:04:36.280,0:04:43.300
stripe somewhere in the middle and then

0:04:40.090,0:04:45.100
after I haven't quite like pasted it to

0:04:43.300,0:04:48.160
my background I can do that control-c

0:04:45.100,0:04:50.980
control-v and that will help me

0:04:48.160,0:04:54.400
you know mass-produce my road and a much

0:04:50.980,0:04:55.870
faster system so I cut a few control V's

0:04:54.400,0:04:59.080
every now and then get your road made

0:04:55.870,0:05:04.140
much quicker so try to get these guys

0:04:59.080,0:05:07.570
organized maybe I'll do one more on the

0:05:04.140,0:05:09.790
UM you also you'll probably fight with

0:05:07.570,0:05:13.780
the tinkerer drawing tool some just try

0:05:09.790,0:05:14.890
to get better at drawing it's definitely

0:05:13.780,0:05:17.220
useful skill you'll notice that we've

0:05:14.890,0:05:20.110
drawn in almost every game we've made

0:05:17.220,0:05:21.400
once you get all of the ones made for a

0:05:20.110,0:05:24.730
single lane here's an even better trick

0:05:21.400,0:05:27.970
you could use this selection tool and

0:05:24.730,0:05:29.080
you can highlight an area and even

0:05:27.970,0:05:30.850
though it's already like pasted on the

0:05:29.080,0:05:34.840
background you can still control C

0:05:30.850,0:05:36.670
control V that whole thing and then you

0:05:34.840,0:05:40.420
can kind of like make a whole lane at a

0:05:36.670,0:05:43.750
time so I'm not worried about what speed

0:05:40.420,0:05:45.880
you draw at just kind of get it to where

0:05:43.750,0:05:47.350
it looks fun and there's no functional

0:05:45.880,0:05:49.390
things happening in this part of the

0:05:47.350,0:05:51.280
game anyway so to be honest you could

0:05:49.390,0:05:52.600
kind of do whatever you wanted I'm if

0:05:51.280,0:05:54.430
you're OCD like me you can see I

0:05:52.600,0:05:57.340
accidentally made a little white line

0:05:54.430,0:06:00.190
there somehow that was not the goal hold

0:05:57.340,0:06:01.960
on I gotta fix that so I'm gonna get rid

0:06:00.190,0:06:04.180
of that guy that was whenever I was

0:06:01.960,0:06:05.590
copying I kind of made that alright now

0:06:04.180,0:06:07.000
let's go ahead and do the functional

0:06:05.590,0:06:08.530
part of the screen and that's the

0:06:07.000,0:06:10.960
victory color at the top so that's the

0:06:08.530,0:06:13.510
only functional part of this game I'm

0:06:10.960,0:06:15.670
gonna choose to do a nice I don't know

0:06:13.510,0:06:18.370
distinct color maybe I want to go with a

0:06:15.670,0:06:21.430
nice pink and I'm just gonna put my

0:06:18.370,0:06:23.590
victory color across the whole top I

0:06:21.430,0:06:24.760
chose to do it the rectangle but you

0:06:23.590,0:06:25.240
could draw it with a pencil whatever you

0:06:24.760,0:06:27.790
wanted

0:06:25.240,0:06:29.650
now that victory color we are going to

0:06:27.790,0:06:32.020
need that so let's go ahead and figure

0:06:29.650,0:06:33.790
out what color that is normally we have

0:06:32.020,0:06:35.320
two eyedropper it's like select that

0:06:33.790,0:06:37.150
color but we've currently got it

0:06:35.320,0:06:40.300
selected so I'm just gonna click on the

0:06:37.150,0:06:41.350
multicolor wheel here and then hex and

0:06:40.300,0:06:44.050
then I'm going to right

0:06:41.350,0:06:45.610
down that color I actually used this

0:06:44.050,0:06:49.780
color quite a bit so I knew what this

0:06:45.610,0:06:51.670
color was it's F F ood five and I

0:06:49.780,0:06:54.280
remember it because even though that's a

0:06:51.670,0:06:56.200
0 a 0 and a 5 it kind of looks like the

0:06:54.280,0:06:56.500
word foods to me I don't know what to

0:06:56.200,0:06:58.180
ask

0:06:56.500,0:07:00.640
so I actually have that one memorized

0:06:58.180,0:07:02.350
which is silly once you've got your

0:07:00.640,0:07:04.810
stage drawn you can go back and start

0:07:02.350,0:07:05.860
adding some actors you can add as many

0:07:04.810,0:07:08.860
actors as you'd like

0:07:05.860,0:07:12.730
I'm gonna choose to add 4 and these are

0:07:08.860,0:07:14.440
gonna be your your villains right I

0:07:12.730,0:07:16.810
think that since it's kind of a car

0:07:14.440,0:07:19.680
theme it'd be nice if if I had a couple

0:07:16.810,0:07:23.380
cars on here maybe I'll put one of the

0:07:19.680,0:07:26.050
yellow cars I think the city life has a

0:07:23.380,0:07:29.860
lot of good cars on it here's a neat

0:07:26.050,0:07:31.420
little like orange racecar it doesn't

0:07:29.860,0:07:34.840
have to be cars though if you don't want

0:07:31.420,0:07:38.290
so for example I think I had spaceships

0:07:34.840,0:07:40.720
in my previous example so whatever you

0:07:38.290,0:07:42.940
would like to do but go through and

0:07:40.720,0:07:44.590
pause the video obviously you probably

0:07:42.940,0:07:47.080
had to pause it a couple times during

0:07:44.590,0:07:48.580
the drawing phase initially I'm just

0:07:47.080,0:07:53.290
kind of fighting with the air to make it

0:07:48.580,0:07:57.340
smaller and then I'll pick my last

0:07:53.290,0:07:59.170
sprite for the top and feel free to do

0:07:57.340,0:08:01.390
all the cars but if you wanted to do

0:07:59.170,0:08:03.430
something crazy I mean you do do

0:08:01.390,0:08:06.220
whatever you want right so here's this

0:08:03.430,0:08:08.190
whole sci-fi library maybe I'll have a

0:08:06.220,0:08:13.060
t-rex at the top right

0:08:08.190,0:08:15.100
don't want to get eaten by a t-rex once

0:08:13.060,0:08:17.260
you've got your enemies in there you

0:08:15.100,0:08:18.430
need to pick your hero what I'm gonna

0:08:17.260,0:08:20.860
pick is my hero

0:08:18.430,0:08:25.030
I'm gonna call my game dragon crossing

0:08:20.860,0:08:27.520
I'm gonna pick a dragon there's dragons

0:08:25.030,0:08:30.580
up in the default area it's one of their

0:08:27.520,0:08:33.700
kind of like built-in things and dragons

0:08:30.580,0:08:35.380
are crazy cuz dragons when you add it on

0:08:33.700,0:08:37.120
you click on this edit dragon it's

0:08:35.380,0:08:39.490
what's called a character it's not even

0:08:37.120,0:08:41.200
an image it's like a character right and

0:08:39.490,0:08:43.690
so you can change whatever you want

0:08:41.200,0:08:46.270
about your dragon you can give it a blue

0:08:43.690,0:08:48.329
body or you can give it you know

0:08:46.270,0:08:50.730
multicolored body

0:08:48.329,0:08:52.980
can add crazy things like you know hats

0:08:50.730,0:08:55.410
or jewelry I'll give mine a little

0:08:52.980,0:08:58.019
necklace here as you do more with tinker

0:08:55.410,0:09:00.480
you'll have more and more things get

0:08:58.019,0:09:01.889
unlocked and so that's kind of what you

0:09:00.480,0:09:05.040
can do with your your character builder

0:09:01.889,0:09:07.499
that I'm gonna hit save here so now I've

0:09:05.040,0:09:09.899
got a blue dragon now the blue dragon

0:09:07.499,0:09:11.459
does come with some code go and hit the

0:09:09.899,0:09:13.529
play button and just see what your code

0:09:11.459,0:09:15.629
currently does and what your code

0:09:13.529,0:09:17.629
currently does which is kind of neat is

0:09:15.629,0:09:21.059
when you hold down your mouse button

0:09:17.629,0:09:23.100
your dragon flies there that's kind of

0:09:21.059,0:09:25.350
cool that's not really that useful for

0:09:23.100,0:09:28.679
us but it's something instead of nothing

0:09:25.350,0:09:30.749
to start with cool so I consider this

0:09:28.679,0:09:32.549
kind of the setup work you probably had

0:09:30.749,0:09:34.649
to pause your video a lot with it but

0:09:32.549,0:09:36.329
hopefully a lot of these things you

0:09:34.649,0:09:39.089
could do without me now what I'm gonna

0:09:36.329,0:09:43.379
do is I'm gonna save my game so I'm

0:09:39.089,0:09:46.559
gonna call mine dragon crossing you can

0:09:43.379,0:09:48.649
call yours whatever you want no need to

0:09:46.559,0:09:54.439
publish it yeah but this is my

0:09:48.649,0:09:54.439
connecting with code day 5 the final day

0:09:55.519,0:09:59.189
and I'm just gonna hit save for now I'm

0:09:57.899,0:10:01.980
not going to publish it yet I'll publish

0:09:59.189,0:10:04.290
it later let's go ahead and glance at

0:10:01.980,0:10:06.239
the code that the dragon had to start

0:10:04.290,0:10:08.610
with and see if there's any of that that

0:10:06.239,0:10:11.910
we would like to keep

0:10:08.610,0:10:13.439
so the code in here actually one of my

0:10:11.910,0:10:14.879
campers just said that they deleted it

0:10:13.439,0:10:17.579
so I'll just delete mine too

0:10:14.879,0:10:19.949
we'll just start fresh that way we don't

0:10:17.579,0:10:22.499
have to think about what's there alright

0:10:19.949,0:10:25.769
so let's go ahead and start in on this

0:10:22.499,0:10:28.649
so first off we want to bring over an on

0:10:25.769,0:10:32.069
start so our dragon when the game starts

0:10:28.649,0:10:33.779
is going to do some stuff and then what

0:10:32.069,0:10:38.579
we want this dragon to do is we want him

0:10:33.779,0:10:41.790
to do some things forever so if we do

0:10:38.579,0:10:45.290
some things forever what he's gonna do

0:10:41.790,0:10:48.299
forever is the dragon is going to move

0:10:45.290,0:10:50.220
just depending on what direction is so

0:10:48.299,0:10:52.110
we need to have some way to switch what

0:10:50.220,0:10:54.299
direction we're going and we have to

0:10:52.110,0:10:55.679
have some way to move we're also going

0:10:54.299,0:10:58.439
to plan ahead a little bit

0:10:55.679,0:11:01.169
so you notice how there are times in my

0:10:58.439,0:11:01.510
game where everybody stopped right just

0:11:01.169,0:11:03.070
like

0:11:01.510,0:11:05.380
everybody stopped so what we're gonna do

0:11:03.070,0:11:07.990
is every sprite in our game today every

0:11:05.380,0:11:10.930
actor is gonna have a variable called

0:11:07.990,0:11:12.610
like is game moving and if the game is

0:11:10.930,0:11:14.380
moving then they're gonna do their movie

0:11:12.610,0:11:16.210
so we're gonna plan ahead we're gonna

0:11:14.380,0:11:20.650
make this variable so go ahead and click

0:11:16.210,0:11:22.870
on variables and click on create

0:11:20.650,0:11:26.430
variable now we want to make a global

0:11:22.870,0:11:32.280
variable so it's gonna be for all actors

0:11:26.430,0:11:36.550
and maybe we'll just call it like moving

0:11:32.280,0:11:39.730
so moving it could be like a 1 people

0:11:36.550,0:11:41.650
are moving or a 0 if people stop moving

0:11:39.730,0:11:43.300
you can call it a more descriptive name

0:11:41.650,0:11:46.810
if you want but I think moving is a fine

0:11:43.300,0:11:48.820
fine name and what I'm gonna do is

0:11:46.810,0:11:51.280
inside my forever movie instead of just

0:11:48.820,0:11:54.400
always having a move I'm gonna like

0:11:51.280,0:11:55.750
check that variable first so to check

0:11:54.400,0:11:58.300
something you heard me say the word

0:11:55.750,0:12:05.170
check that's an if statement so if

0:11:58.300,0:12:08.470
statements are over in control and so

0:12:05.170,0:12:10.510
we're gonna say if some condition then

0:12:08.470,0:12:12.190
run this code and the code we're going

0:12:10.510,0:12:14.380
to run is going to be movement let's go

0:12:12.190,0:12:15.580
and do that condition first so what we

0:12:14.380,0:12:18.820
want to do is we want to check that

0:12:15.580,0:12:21.850
variable moving and if it's a 1 then we

0:12:18.820,0:12:25.690
are moving and if it's a 0 or not moving

0:12:21.850,0:12:29.650
so to check if something as a 1 or a 0

0:12:25.690,0:12:34.450
that's an operator's see if you can find

0:12:29.650,0:12:36.460
the equals it looks like it's the second

0:12:34.450,0:12:38.170
one down in a bullying category here and

0:12:36.460,0:12:39.760
you'll notice that it's got that diamond

0:12:38.170,0:12:43.860
shape so that means that it's something

0:12:39.760,0:12:47.550
that can go in to a condition right and

0:12:43.860,0:12:50.440
so we're going to check if moving is

0:12:47.550,0:12:54.430
equal to 1 so that's what our two sides

0:12:50.440,0:12:59.370
are going to be so go to variables see

0:12:54.430,0:12:59.370
if you can find your moving variable

0:13:02.510,0:13:12.980
so if moving equals one then we're going

0:13:08.360,0:13:15.470
to do some movement again if I go too

0:13:12.980,0:13:18.320
fast feel free to pause the video just

0:13:15.470,0:13:22.300
trying to help people go at a pace

0:13:18.320,0:13:25.459
they're comfortable so we want to move

0:13:22.300,0:13:26.839
we could run our game right now but

0:13:25.459,0:13:28.160
there's a good chance that nothing will

0:13:26.839,0:13:31.459
happen because what's the value of

0:13:28.160,0:13:33.170
moving right now we never said it and I

0:13:31.459,0:13:35.510
think things probably start off as zero

0:13:33.170,0:13:37.040
or even worse they start up as on set so

0:13:35.510,0:13:39.500
we've got to do if we want to even see

0:13:37.040,0:13:43.459
anything we're going to set moving to be

0:13:39.500,0:13:46.490
one at start and then later when we hit

0:13:43.459,0:13:48.649
somebody or win I will set it to zero so

0:13:46.490,0:13:50.180
let's go ahead and do some setup things

0:13:48.649,0:13:52.279
just so we can even see our game working

0:13:50.180,0:14:03.050
so the first thing I want to do is I

0:13:52.279,0:14:06.139
want to set moving to b1 and so what

0:14:03.050,0:14:09.529
this does is this will make my game be

0:14:06.139,0:14:11.029
moving by default and later if I want to

0:14:09.529,0:14:13.430
make it stop all I'll set it to zero

0:14:11.029,0:14:14.660
right while we're doing setup work up

0:14:13.430,0:14:16.970
here let's go and do one more thing that

0:14:14.660,0:14:19.910
I forgot to do earlier and that is I

0:14:16.970,0:14:22.069
want the dragon to only turn left and

0:14:19.910,0:14:25.130
right I don't want him to like turn his

0:14:22.069,0:14:26.360
body up and so that's a command we'll go

0:14:25.130,0:14:28.160
and put it in together then we'll talk

0:14:26.360,0:14:35.630
about it it's in motion

0:14:28.160,0:14:37.480
it's called set rotation style and the

0:14:35.630,0:14:40.250
rotation style that I want to use is

0:14:37.480,0:14:41.930
left-right rotation and so what that

0:14:40.250,0:14:44.510
does is that will make sure his feet are

0:14:41.930,0:14:46.339
always pointed down and you can turn

0:14:44.510,0:14:49.449
left and right but there won't ever be a

0:14:46.339,0:14:52.430
time where I could speak yo crazy right

0:14:49.449,0:14:55.459
now we could run it right now and our

0:14:52.430,0:14:58.000
dragon would start moving and our dragon

0:14:55.459,0:15:00.639
moved really fast right off the screen I

0:14:58.000,0:15:03.260
didn't mean for him to go that fast

0:15:00.639,0:15:07.819
campers and the idea what did I forget

0:15:03.260,0:15:10.699
to add that'll slow it down some yeah I

0:15:07.819,0:15:13.209
forgot to add a weight so I'm moving 10

0:15:10.699,0:15:16.209
pixels infinitely fast

0:15:13.209,0:15:20.949
is lucky I even saw my dragon so I need

0:15:16.209,0:15:23.589
to add a delay a weight a delay is in

0:15:20.949,0:15:25.929
the control area it's near the bottom

0:15:23.589,0:15:27.610
it's about fourth up from the bottom and

0:15:25.929,0:15:32.800
you can drop it in here with your move

0:15:27.610,0:15:35.050
10 pixels now the delay that I like to

0:15:32.800,0:15:39.850
use I use this and a lot of my games

0:15:35.050,0:15:42.790
it's 0.05 kind of a crazy number but

0:15:39.850,0:15:44.800
it's one twentieth of a second it makes

0:15:42.790,0:15:48.369
our game move at about 20 frames per

0:15:44.800,0:15:51.189
second and I find that that's a good a

0:15:48.369,0:15:54.879
good number to kind of make things work

0:15:51.189,0:15:58.119
about right so if I run it now it's

0:15:54.879,0:16:00.730
better it's still not great what happens

0:15:58.119,0:16:04.899
is my my dragon kind of slowly glides

0:16:00.730,0:16:07.709
off the screen while that's interesting

0:16:04.899,0:16:11.110
but isn't really what I was after

0:16:07.709,0:16:14.139
so I want to do two things one is when I

0:16:11.110,0:16:17.369
get to the edge I want to bounce back so

0:16:14.139,0:16:17.369
I'm gonna add that it's in motion

0:16:17.649,0:16:24.369
and it's if on edge bounce you can put

0:16:22.569,0:16:26.379
it wherever you want in your code I'm

0:16:24.369,0:16:30.910
gonna put it right after the movement

0:16:26.379,0:16:33.790
and then also I don't like how my dragon

0:16:30.910,0:16:35.319
was kind of like just gliding right this

0:16:33.790,0:16:37.360
is a character it's got more advanced

0:16:35.319,0:16:39.399
things of that so I want my dragon to

0:16:37.360,0:16:41.379
like look like it's walking or running

0:16:39.399,0:16:45.850
or something like that and so let's go

0:16:41.379,0:16:47.439
into looks now there's two ways you can

0:16:45.850,0:16:50.519
do this I'm going to show you the the

0:16:47.439,0:17:01.209
way that I like to do it and I like to

0:16:50.519,0:17:02.740
say switch to costume run now there's a

0:17:01.209,0:17:05.980
couple different ways to do that I think

0:17:02.740,0:17:08.799
the the code that came in actually used

0:17:05.980,0:17:09.730
an animation and so they had like an

0:17:08.799,0:17:12.730
animate run

0:17:09.730,0:17:14.559
I actually prefer this one the switch to

0:17:12.730,0:17:17.319
costume run because it will stop

0:17:14.559,0:17:19.089
instantly if you want to someday you can

0:17:17.319,0:17:22.750
play with both but this is the one that

0:17:19.089,0:17:25.899
I want so now it should do things better

0:17:22.750,0:17:29.210
it should have my dragon

0:17:25.899,0:17:31.490
animating kind of like a switching to

0:17:29.210,0:17:33.049
costume run now you notice that Ron is a

0:17:31.490,0:17:35.929
little different from costumes we've

0:17:33.049,0:17:38.240
using the past run is actually a list of

0:17:35.929,0:17:40.789
costumes so by calling switch to costume

0:17:38.240,0:17:41.840
run it actually does animate through

0:17:40.789,0:17:43.880
different things it doesn't just switch

0:17:41.840,0:17:45.950
to one costume but that's kind of neat

0:17:43.880,0:17:48.889
you can also speed your dragon up a

0:17:45.950,0:17:51.230
little bit maybe like 15 or 20 would

0:17:48.889,0:17:54.200
make for a more interesting dragon

0:17:51.230,0:17:56.740
speeding I think 15 I don't know it just

0:17:54.200,0:18:00.549
kind of feels like it's running better

0:17:56.740,0:18:05.470
cool so my game is making good progress

0:18:00.549,0:18:08.330
I've got my hero running back and forth

0:18:05.470,0:18:11.630
and so what I want to do is I want to

0:18:08.330,0:18:14.059
make my hero be able to change

0:18:11.630,0:18:17.659
directions right so if I hit like up

0:18:14.059,0:18:19.970
arrow I want the dragon to go up if I

0:18:17.659,0:18:23.360
hit right right now it would go right or

0:18:19.970,0:18:27.200
down or left cool so let's go ahead and

0:18:23.360,0:18:30.799
see if we can add some things to let our

0:18:27.200,0:18:35.139
hero change direction so what I'm

0:18:30.799,0:18:35.139
looking for is events

0:18:35.240,0:18:41.450
and I'm going to start grabbing these

0:18:36.559,0:18:44.570
different arrow key presses so inside of

0:18:41.450,0:18:47.720
minutes I grab the third one down and I

0:18:44.570,0:18:49.730
said win up arrow pressed so when an up

0:18:47.720,0:18:55.399
arrow is pressed I want my dragon to

0:18:49.730,0:18:57.289
point up so that's in motion and it's

0:18:55.399,0:19:01.539
point in direction I always got to find

0:18:57.289,0:19:05.809
it right here we go point in direction

0:19:01.539,0:19:07.460
and I want it to be up so I kind of

0:19:05.809,0:19:12.440
click on the zero up here and hopefully

0:19:07.460,0:19:15.289
it pops to zero and that's actually

0:19:12.440,0:19:17.870
enough I couldn't test my game now so if

0:19:15.289,0:19:20.659
I run it now my dragon started by

0:19:17.870,0:19:23.870
running to the right and if I hit the up

0:19:20.659,0:19:27.350
arrow then it switches to to running up

0:19:23.870,0:19:29.419
which is good so go ahead and pause the

0:19:27.350,0:19:32.000
video for a minute and see if you can

0:19:29.419,0:19:33.740
get in all four directions I'm going to

0:19:32.000,0:19:35.420
choose not to show you mine

0:19:33.740,0:19:37.010
I'm just going to let you do it but

0:19:35.420,0:19:39.850
pause the video and see if you can get

0:19:37.010,0:19:43.100
in up down left and right

0:19:39.850,0:19:47.390
alright so I got the rest of mine added

0:19:43.100,0:19:48.890
in so up left right down you can look at

0:19:47.390,0:19:50.540
the numbers here but even better is you

0:19:48.890,0:19:52.610
know you you just click on it and then

0:19:50.540,0:19:54.770
you you see the value right there and

0:19:52.610,0:19:57.710
make sure that your dragon moves around

0:19:54.770,0:20:00.230
or whatever your hero is so when I hit

0:19:57.710,0:20:03.290
left goes left up goes up right goes

0:20:00.230,0:20:03.890
right down goes down and if you hit a

0:20:03.290,0:20:05.840
wall

0:20:03.890,0:20:07.490
you should bounce off of it now my

0:20:05.840,0:20:08.929
campers in here the first thing they did

0:20:07.490,0:20:11.059
is they discovered that if you hold down

0:20:08.929,0:20:13.520
a button you can kind of sort of go into

0:20:11.059,0:20:15.860
the wall a little bit that's not really

0:20:13.520,0:20:18.110
the goal but that's what that's what my

0:20:15.860,0:20:20.600
campers discovered alright so let's go

0:20:18.110,0:20:22.250
ahead and save it real quick so go and

0:20:20.600,0:20:25.100
click on save so we've done a lot of

0:20:22.250,0:20:27.500
coding we don't want to lose that and

0:20:25.100,0:20:31.220
let's actually start working on our

0:20:27.500,0:20:32.750
first of our enemies so you can start

0:20:31.220,0:20:34.730
with any one you want

0:20:32.750,0:20:36.920
I think I'm gonna start with the the

0:20:34.730,0:20:38.780
convertible here and one thing that

0:20:36.920,0:20:40.460
happens a lot in coding is if you click

0:20:38.780,0:20:44.450
on the convertible right now you can see

0:20:40.460,0:20:46.850
they has no code at all we could totally

0:20:44.450,0:20:49.580
write their code from scratch that would

0:20:46.850,0:20:51.950
be no problem but one thing that you do

0:20:49.580,0:20:53.990
a lot in coding is go back to your hero

0:20:51.950,0:20:56.900
we can go back to the dragon if you

0:20:53.990,0:20:59.120
think about this thread right here just

0:20:56.900,0:21:00.890
this thread not not all the winds if you

0:20:59.120,0:21:03.830
think about just this thread this is

0:21:00.890,0:21:05.150
actually pretty similar to what the what

0:21:03.830,0:21:08.620
the enemies are gonna do because they're

0:21:05.150,0:21:11.240
gonna have to forever if they're moving

0:21:08.620,0:21:13.190
move pixels and go back and forth so

0:21:11.240,0:21:15.320
what we're gonna do is we're gonna save

0:21:13.190,0:21:17.420
ourselves some time so I'm gonna click

0:21:15.320,0:21:20.270
on this little handle on the left of one

0:21:17.420,0:21:22.730
start and I'm going to take this block

0:21:20.270,0:21:24.200
of code and I'm gonna drop it onto one

0:21:22.730,0:21:27.230
of these other sprites so I'm gonna drop

0:21:24.200,0:21:29.630
it onto my blue convertible now when

0:21:27.230,0:21:32.240
that when you let go like when you drop

0:21:29.630,0:21:35.150
it there it stays in the dragon so it's

0:21:32.240,0:21:37.400
not like you you you cut it out but if

0:21:35.150,0:21:38.690
you go to the convertible now I you can

0:21:37.400,0:21:41.720
see that you've got a lot of code to

0:21:38.690,0:21:43.910
start with which is which is cool so

0:21:41.720,0:21:45.470
there are some things that we don't want

0:21:43.910,0:21:47.410
right there are some things that we're

0:21:45.470,0:21:50.260
going to change but this same

0:21:47.410,0:21:52.180
this time right and when you when you do

0:21:50.260,0:21:54.850
a lot of software development people

0:21:52.180,0:21:56.410
people love to save time right so let's

0:21:54.850,0:22:00.150
think about what's different at this

0:21:56.410,0:22:03.460
well the first thing that's different is

0:22:00.150,0:22:05.530
each car is not responsible for this

0:22:03.460,0:22:07.600
variable moving so I actually don't

0:22:05.530,0:22:09.730
really it doesn't do anything bad but I

0:22:07.600,0:22:11.320
don't really need this command for each

0:22:09.730,0:22:13.300
car so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

0:22:11.320,0:22:15.430
click on the right handle and the right

0:22:13.300,0:22:18.070
handle selects just that one and I'm

0:22:15.430,0:22:19.750
just gonna pop that one out now you

0:22:18.070,0:22:21.280
could set it over here that'd be fine

0:22:19.750,0:22:24.030
but I just don't need it at all so I'm

0:22:21.280,0:22:27.790
just gonna drag it over the trashcan

0:22:24.030,0:22:30.940
likewise you'll notice that my car here

0:22:27.790,0:22:32.890
has this switch to costume run that was

0:22:30.940,0:22:35.560
for the dragon right a car doesn't even

0:22:32.890,0:22:38.920
have a run so I want to pop that out as

0:22:35.560,0:22:40.180
well and again you could set it over

0:22:38.920,0:22:41.410
here if you wanted but I don't really

0:22:40.180,0:22:44.260
need it so I'm just gonna throw it in

0:22:41.410,0:22:49.600
the trash and the neat thing is is that

0:22:44.260,0:22:52.960
just by copying that code and going here

0:22:49.600,0:22:54.880
you can see that my car is moving now

0:22:52.960,0:22:58.380
this car had some unexpected behavior

0:22:54.880,0:23:04.870
this car is moving the wrong direction

0:22:58.380,0:23:06.400
well that's something I I was not

0:23:04.870,0:23:09.400
expecting that

0:23:06.400,0:23:11.140
so since my car is moving the wrong

0:23:09.400,0:23:14.530
direction what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

0:23:11.140,0:23:16.270
go into their image and point them to go

0:23:14.530,0:23:17.440
that way right there's a couple

0:23:16.270,0:23:19.600
different ways you could do it but my

0:23:17.440,0:23:22.170
car my convertible is going the wrong

0:23:19.600,0:23:24.550
direction I think I know how to do this

0:23:22.170,0:23:28.300
so if you have a vehicle that's going

0:23:24.550,0:23:33.430
the wrong direction click on this little

0:23:28.300,0:23:35.470
like dotted square drag it over your

0:23:33.430,0:23:38.440
whole car trying to make your car as

0:23:35.470,0:23:39.730
centered as possible inside of it and

0:23:38.440,0:23:42.010
then there's a button down here I

0:23:39.730,0:23:44.440
believe which is supposed to flip the

0:23:42.010,0:23:46.570
direction of the car I don't click click

0:23:44.440,0:23:49.140
on it again so you can flip your car

0:23:46.570,0:23:51.610
such that it's pointing to the right

0:23:49.140,0:23:54.310
that was that was a very unexpected

0:23:51.610,0:23:57.070
feature whenever I practice this game it

0:23:54.310,0:23:59.830
didn't come up so I flipped it to the

0:23:57.070,0:24:01.149
right alright I think it's finally

0:23:59.830,0:24:04.450
behaving properly

0:24:01.149,0:24:07.359
so if I hit play my car is going the

0:24:04.450,0:24:09.759
correct direction again super alright so

0:24:07.359,0:24:13.389
a little a little stumble there so let's

0:24:09.759,0:24:15.399
go write some more code in him so he

0:24:13.389,0:24:19.029
wants to go back and forth that's all

0:24:15.399,0:24:22.359
true but the convertible also has a job

0:24:19.029,0:24:25.419
and his job is to check to see if he's

0:24:22.359,0:24:27.159
touching the dragon now the dragon

0:24:25.419,0:24:29.440
couldn't check to see if he's touching

0:24:27.159,0:24:30.519
like the blue car and the yellow car and

0:24:29.440,0:24:32.429
the orange car do you check them all

0:24:30.519,0:24:34.389
there it's actually easier for the cars

0:24:32.429,0:24:35.469
because they don't have to check for one

0:24:34.389,0:24:37.509
thing they just have to check for the

0:24:35.469,0:24:39.099
dragon so what I want to do is I want to

0:24:37.509,0:24:40.989
check for the dragon to check for

0:24:39.099,0:24:43.679
something as an if-statement so I go

0:24:40.989,0:24:46.210
into control and I find an if statement

0:24:43.679,0:24:48.159
and you can put this if statement in a

0:24:46.210,0:24:49.779
couple different places I'm going to

0:24:48.159,0:24:53.889
choose to put it right after the

0:24:49.779,0:24:55.509
movement right so I move and then I'm

0:24:53.889,0:25:01.299
gonna check hey am i hitting the dragon

0:24:55.509,0:25:03.460
right now that if check right here this

0:25:01.299,0:25:06.849
is a sensing type of thing so let's go

0:25:03.460,0:25:08.559
into sensing and what we want to do is

0:25:06.849,0:25:11.259
we want to this is always kind of funny

0:25:08.559,0:25:13.239
we want to drag over if touching mouse

0:25:11.259,0:25:16.059
pointer wait why did I put in mouse

0:25:13.239,0:25:18.789
pointer and it's because mouse pointer

0:25:16.059,0:25:22.479
is an argument to this function and you

0:25:18.789,0:25:25.839
can change it and you can find your hero

0:25:22.479,0:25:30.759
so for me my hero is a dragon so I'm

0:25:25.839,0:25:33.519
gonna say if touching dragon then so now

0:25:30.759,0:25:35.950
this this is the next question my car's

0:25:33.519,0:25:38.109
right here he's not he's not like the

0:25:35.950,0:25:40.389
one who's in charge of this game but he

0:25:38.109,0:25:42.940
knows he's the one who has the smarts I

0:25:40.389,0:25:45.929
just touched the dragon and so he needs

0:25:42.940,0:25:50.080
to somehow tell everybody else everybody

0:25:45.929,0:25:53.349
stop moving and the way you do that is

0:25:50.080,0:25:55.029
you broadcast and events so this is

0:25:53.349,0:25:57.219
something new right so this is a brand

0:25:55.029,0:26:01.899
new skill or learning go up to events

0:25:57.219,0:26:04.330
and events or things that happen like an

0:26:01.899,0:26:06.989
event is the game starts or an actor

0:26:04.330,0:26:10.089
Clint but you can also make your own

0:26:06.989,0:26:12.029
events so scroll down a little bit until

0:26:10.089,0:26:14.440
I could get into this events area and

0:26:12.029,0:26:16.450
find the one that says broadcast

0:26:14.440,0:26:20.129
asked and then has a little box next to

0:26:16.450,0:26:23.379
it and drag it and put it inside here

0:26:20.129,0:26:25.960
and so what he's gonna do is he's gonna

0:26:23.379,0:26:27.820
broadcast which means tell everybody

0:26:25.960,0:26:30.580
else that something happened and he's

0:26:27.820,0:26:35.230
gonna broadcast a new event called hit

0:26:30.580,0:26:37.450
and so he's gonna say hit and so just

0:26:35.230,0:26:42.190
everybody everybody with ears to hear I

0:26:37.450,0:26:44.049
can hear him say it right now maybe he's

0:26:42.190,0:26:46.389
the one that yells hit but I'm gonna put

0:26:44.049,0:26:47.379
this coat on everybody else right so

0:26:46.389,0:26:49.000
I'll tell off let's go ahead and do that

0:26:47.379,0:26:50.679
really quick just cuz it'll be fun take

0:26:49.000,0:26:53.590
this code and give it to the yellow car

0:26:50.679,0:26:57.159
and then take this code and also give it

0:26:53.590,0:27:02.200
to the orange car and take this code and

0:26:57.159,0:27:04.419
give it to the t-rex so now if you hit

0:27:02.200,0:27:06.419
play it's gonna be like crazy which will

0:27:04.419,0:27:10.419
be kind of fun if you hit play now

0:27:06.419,0:27:14.139
everybody moves they're all going the

0:27:10.419,0:27:15.580
exact same speed right now your dragon

0:27:14.139,0:27:18.789
is the only one that has the ability to

0:27:15.580,0:27:20.529
steer and what we're gonna do is

0:27:18.789,0:27:22.360
whenever you hit somebody they're gonna

0:27:20.529,0:27:24.850
broadcast this message hit so they're

0:27:22.360,0:27:26.019
all broadcasting hit right now so every

0:27:24.850,0:27:27.940
time I hit one of these guys they're

0:27:26.019,0:27:30.399
screaming hit like if only I could hear

0:27:27.940,0:27:32.110
them scream but nobody's like doing

0:27:30.399,0:27:35.590
anything right so it's like somebody

0:27:32.110,0:27:38.769
else fire but nobody boost so let's go

0:27:35.590,0:27:41.259
ahead and do the other side of that

0:27:38.769,0:27:43.690
let's listen for somebody to say hit so

0:27:41.259,0:27:46.929
the person that's gonna listen for this

0:27:43.690,0:27:49.179
hit is actually the dragon so the dragon

0:27:46.929,0:27:50.379
is gonna listen so I'm just going to

0:27:49.179,0:27:52.419
kind of move this code out of the way a

0:27:50.379,0:27:57.009
little bit it's gonna listen and say

0:27:52.419,0:28:01.299
when I receive so when the dragon

0:27:57.009,0:28:04.779
receives hit he knows hey I've been hit

0:28:01.299,0:28:07.750
and the dragons job is to tell everybody

0:28:04.779,0:28:09.580
to stop moving right that's the nice

0:28:07.750,0:28:11.049
thing about this variable so everybody's

0:28:09.580,0:28:12.789
got this variable moving that they're

0:28:11.049,0:28:14.799
listening for so I want to tell

0:28:12.789,0:28:22.419
everybody to stop moving for a second

0:28:14.799,0:28:25.899
so I go to variables I go to set and if

0:28:22.419,0:28:28.179
I set moving to zero then everybody's

0:28:25.899,0:28:31.809
gonna stop let's just check them

0:28:28.179,0:28:35.470
sure that that works so when I hit

0:28:31.809,0:28:37.570
somebody they yell hit and then when the

0:28:35.470,0:28:41.499
dragon hears them y'all hit he says

0:28:37.570,0:28:44.080
everybody stop so I run it now I'm just

0:28:41.499,0:28:47.799
gonna run right into somebody I'm and as

0:28:44.080,0:28:49.590
soon as I hit them everybody stops now

0:28:47.799,0:28:52.450
interestingly the game is still running

0:28:49.590,0:28:54.909
it's just that nobody is moving because

0:28:52.450,0:28:56.379
moving has been set to zero so it's a

0:28:54.909,0:28:58.119
really neat way to communicate so we've

0:28:56.379,0:29:00.909
learned two ways to communicate one is

0:28:58.119,0:29:03.190
to broadcast an event hit and then

0:29:00.909,0:29:06.279
another is with global variables right

0:29:03.190,0:29:09.580
so he tells everybody now whenever he

0:29:06.279,0:29:11.499
does get hit so whatever the dragon gets

0:29:09.580,0:29:14.799
hit he wants to tell everybody to freeze

0:29:11.499,0:29:16.899
um he wants to say some things and then

0:29:14.799,0:29:18.759
he's gonna let the game carry on so if

0:29:16.899,0:29:24.970
he wants to say something that's in

0:29:18.759,0:29:26.679
looks and find the big scary save up

0:29:24.970,0:29:32.409
block the one that has the for two

0:29:26.679,0:29:37.929
seconds on it and the dragon is gonna

0:29:32.409,0:29:38.529
say ouch and then he's gonna say play

0:29:37.929,0:29:43.389
again

0:29:38.529,0:29:45.460
why should mark alright and you can

0:29:43.389,0:29:46.809
check that if you want to check it just

0:29:45.460,0:29:48.580
by running into somebody so now

0:29:46.809,0:29:52.240
everybody will stop and it'll say ouch

0:29:48.580,0:29:53.470
play again it says that for two seconds

0:29:52.240,0:29:56.169
if you want to make it happen for three

0:29:53.470,0:30:00.309
seconds you can and then what I want to

0:29:56.169,0:30:02.740
do is I want to reset the game before I

0:30:00.309,0:30:04.480
restart playing again right so to reset

0:30:02.740,0:30:07.539
the game what I want to do is I want to

0:30:04.480,0:30:09.909
move my dragon back to a good starting

0:30:07.539,0:30:11.350
spot now the best way to find a good

0:30:09.909,0:30:13.600
starting spot is just to kind of move

0:30:11.350,0:30:14.799
your mouse to that spot and personally I

0:30:13.600,0:30:19.230
like to just write the number down

0:30:14.799,0:30:25.749
really quick mine is negative five sixty

0:30:19.230,0:30:27.850
negative 279 I find that writing it down

0:30:25.749,0:30:30.070
just makes life easier than trying to

0:30:27.850,0:30:33.879
memorize it and so now I'm gonna go to

0:30:30.070,0:30:37.119
motion I'm going to say go to X Y and

0:30:33.879,0:30:38.830
I'm going to type in that number I think

0:30:37.119,0:30:40.240
I'm gonna type in 280 just because I

0:30:38.830,0:30:43.480
always like nice round number

0:30:40.240,0:30:46.000
the 270 died and you can keep testing

0:30:43.480,0:30:49.540
things in small chunks but now it should

0:30:46.000,0:30:53.470
say ouch play again and then it should

0:30:49.540,0:30:54.610
move you back to the start I think that

0:30:53.470,0:30:57.730
looks pretty good actually I might

0:30:54.610,0:31:01.390
prefer mine just a little lower maybe

0:30:57.730,0:31:04.510
I'll do negative to 300 being very picky

0:31:01.390,0:31:07.390
here sometimes whenever you're the game

0:31:04.510,0:31:09.910
designer you're picky though so he says

0:31:07.390,0:31:12.850
I'll play again so it resets the dragon

0:31:09.910,0:31:14.710
to that spot I also want to make sure

0:31:12.850,0:31:16.809
because I might have been going up when

0:31:14.710,0:31:18.640
I died I want to make sure that I'm

0:31:16.809,0:31:20.260
pointing to the right because when I

0:31:18.640,0:31:21.190
reset the game I always want to start to

0:31:20.260,0:31:23.260
the right because I've kind of got that

0:31:21.190,0:31:27.580
safe zone at the bottom so I want to

0:31:23.260,0:31:30.280
find point in direction here's the point

0:31:27.580,0:31:32.290
in direction I don't want to make sure

0:31:30.280,0:31:34.809
it says 90 degrees which is the default

0:31:32.290,0:31:37.420
so now even if I'm going up at the

0:31:34.809,0:31:40.120
moment I die I'm going to be going to

0:31:37.420,0:31:42.130
the right here and then what I'm gonna

0:31:40.120,0:31:45.190
choose to do this is optional I'm gonna

0:31:42.130,0:31:47.020
choose to wait for one more second just

0:31:45.190,0:31:49.600
so the person can kind of like get their

0:31:47.020,0:31:53.350
bearings again waiting for a second was

0:31:49.600,0:31:54.790
in control and delay is like forth on

0:31:53.350,0:31:59.020
the bottom we use that one all the time

0:31:54.790,0:32:00.880
and then I'm gonna restart the game so

0:31:59.020,0:32:08.670
to restart the game I just got to go

0:32:00.880,0:32:08.670
back into variables I've got to find set

0:32:08.820,0:32:17.470
moving and to restart the game I'm gonna

0:32:12.580,0:32:19.840
set it to 1 and everybody is gonna hear

0:32:17.470,0:32:22.120
that because their code if you go look

0:32:19.840,0:32:24.880
at it it says if moving then they're

0:32:22.120,0:32:31.420
gonna like come back to life right so

0:32:24.880,0:32:33.490
let's go ahead and try our game so now I

0:32:31.420,0:32:35.260
should be able to walk around or no

0:32:33.490,0:32:37.660
they're all coming for me and if I hit

0:32:35.260,0:32:41.110
somebody it says ouch play again and

0:32:37.660,0:32:42.670
then it puts me back to the bottom it

0:32:41.110,0:32:45.010
waits for a second just to let the

0:32:42.670,0:32:49.950
player kind of get their bearings and

0:32:45.010,0:32:52.980
then it plays again hi I'm in trouble

0:32:49.950,0:32:53.550
I'll play again and then it takes you to

0:32:52.980,0:32:56.780
the bottom

0:32:53.550,0:33:00.000
so to be honest our game is fully ready

0:32:56.780,0:33:01.860
except for we can't win right so if you

0:33:00.000,0:33:03.960
get to the top you can't win another

0:33:01.860,0:33:05.940
thing that I'd like to change is I'd

0:33:03.960,0:33:09.090
like to make my cars be different speeds

0:33:05.940,0:33:12.270
right I think I'm gonna implement win

0:33:09.090,0:33:14.280
first so I'm gonna win first and then

0:33:12.270,0:33:15.690
I'm gonna create a way for my cars to

0:33:14.280,0:33:17.160
kind of like be at variable speeds it

0:33:15.690,0:33:18.420
kind of makes for like an interesting

0:33:17.160,0:33:20.280
pattern if they all go at different

0:33:18.420,0:33:21.570
speeds or as like right now it's pretty

0:33:20.280,0:33:25.050
easy to win right I just kind of go

0:33:21.570,0:33:28.820
straight up at the top all right so

0:33:25.050,0:33:33.750
let's go ahead and and check for a win

0:33:28.820,0:33:35.850
so to check for a win my dragon has to

0:33:33.750,0:33:39.060
check if they're touching that color at

0:33:35.850,0:33:42.660
the top so a check is an in-state lift

0:33:39.060,0:33:44.280
so go into an if statement and we have

0:33:42.660,0:33:46.560
to think about where do we want this if

0:33:44.280,0:33:48.810
statement and where I want this if

0:33:46.560,0:33:51.690
statement is I want it right after where

0:33:48.810,0:33:54.960
the dragon moves so the dragon moves and

0:33:51.690,0:33:56.790
then I want to check if I'm if I've won

0:33:54.960,0:33:58.140
the game right I always like to put it

0:33:56.790,0:33:59.580
right after a move because that's the

0:33:58.140,0:34:01.830
moment where I can know if it happens

0:33:59.580,0:34:04.380
and the thing I want to check for is I

0:34:01.830,0:34:07.170
want to check check if I'm touching a

0:34:04.380,0:34:12.210
color and so I'm going to go ahead and

0:34:07.170,0:34:16.919
go to sensing and this time we want

0:34:12.210,0:34:20.429
touching color by the way this is a good

0:34:16.919,0:34:23.850
time to reflect on things so sometimes

0:34:20.429,0:34:27.000
you're touching another actor and in

0:34:23.850,0:34:29.040
that case you say touching mouse pointer

0:34:27.000,0:34:31.860
the new changes that actor and other

0:34:29.040,0:34:34.050
times you want touching color and so you

0:34:31.860,0:34:35.520
use this touching color and with that

0:34:34.050,0:34:38.940
you have to go figure out what that

0:34:35.520,0:34:43.310
color was in your stage now I planned

0:34:38.940,0:34:46.830
ahead and I wrote down my color long ago

0:34:43.310,0:34:51.990
and my color is my favorite color which

0:34:46.830,0:34:56.250
is foods but I'm kinda remember it's not

0:34:51.990,0:34:58.490
OHS it's actually zeros and a 5 right so

0:34:56.250,0:35:00.800
my color is that

0:34:58.490,0:35:02.150
I've written it down earlier again if

0:35:00.800,0:35:03.560
you're working in this box make sure you

0:35:02.150,0:35:05.570
get good at using the left and right

0:35:03.560,0:35:07.220
arrow keys so click in there once with

0:35:05.570,0:35:09.410
your mouse and then never click again

0:35:07.220,0:35:11.330
with your mouse and then use the left

0:35:09.410,0:35:14.630
and right arrow keys and delete to kind

0:35:11.330,0:35:15.950
of like work in that text box so you'll

0:35:14.630,0:35:17.390
know that it works when this color

0:35:15.950,0:35:19.670
matches that color

0:35:17.390,0:35:21.800
so I think that I've got that set now

0:35:19.670,0:35:24.080
inside of here we want something to

0:35:21.800,0:35:26.300
happen there's a bunch of ways you could

0:35:24.080,0:35:29.150
implement this you could put code like

0:35:26.300,0:35:31.190
this this code right here right in there

0:35:29.150,0:35:33.950
that would be fine you could make a

0:35:31.190,0:35:36.710
function that would be fine but today

0:35:33.950,0:35:38.330
we're learning about broadcasting events

0:35:36.710,0:35:39.619
and listening for events so we're gonna

0:35:38.330,0:35:41.480
do something that's a little silly but

0:35:39.619,0:35:43.880
but it's good for practice we're gonna

0:35:41.480,0:35:46.640
make an event that we broadcast called

0:35:43.880,0:35:48.619
win and then we are gonna listen for it

0:35:46.640,0:35:49.910
and that is a little unnecessary you

0:35:48.619,0:35:51.320
could just call a function or something

0:35:49.910,0:35:53.270
like that but I want to practice with

0:35:51.320,0:35:55.790
events today so let's go and practice

0:35:53.270,0:35:58.700
our last event for today so click on

0:35:55.790,0:36:06.220
events and whenever I'm touching that

0:35:58.700,0:36:09.230
color I've got a broadcast the event win

0:36:06.220,0:36:11.540
now anybody could listen for win that

0:36:09.230,0:36:13.760
would be fine but instead what I'm gonna

0:36:11.540,0:36:16.490
do is I'm gonna listen for my own events

0:36:13.760,0:36:18.800
right so i broadcast win and then i'm

0:36:16.490,0:36:20.690
gonna listen for it over here and the

0:36:18.800,0:36:24.290
reason I wanted to do it this way is

0:36:20.690,0:36:28.640
because win is actually pretty similar

0:36:24.290,0:36:32.330
to hit so to save time cuz I like the

0:36:28.640,0:36:35.359
save time I'm gonna make a copy of this

0:36:32.330,0:36:37.970
event so I collect it with the left

0:36:35.359,0:36:43.520
handle I hit control C and I hit control

0:36:37.970,0:36:47.300
V and now I'm gonna change it so this

0:36:43.520,0:36:51.100
was my hit up here and this is my win

0:36:47.300,0:36:53.869
down here so when I receive win

0:36:51.100,0:36:58.070
everybody stops moving just like they

0:36:53.869,0:37:06.920
did before except for I'm gonna say you

0:36:58.070,0:37:08.690
win you win I always think it's

0:37:06.920,0:37:12.290
interesting when you make games how

0:37:08.690,0:37:15.020
similar the code is to wedding and lose

0:37:12.290,0:37:16.790
because you either win or you lose but

0:37:15.020,0:37:18.320
either way the game is over it's just a

0:37:16.790,0:37:21.860
matter of what you say to your player

0:37:18.320,0:37:26.180
and in this case we're gonna stop

0:37:21.860,0:37:30.070
everybody moving say you win if you'd

0:37:26.180,0:37:30.070
like you can also ask them to play again

0:37:32.170,0:37:37.520
so you win play again and then you're

0:37:36.290,0:37:38.930
gonna go back to the start

0:37:37.520,0:37:40.790
you're gonna point in the correct

0:37:38.930,0:37:42.380
direction you're gonna wait to let them

0:37:40.790,0:37:46.340
get their bearings and then you're gonna

0:37:42.380,0:37:48.470
start it up so I think we just finished

0:37:46.340,0:37:50.720
this game so it's time to try it out

0:37:48.470,0:37:53.300
Oh actually there's one more thing I

0:37:50.720,0:37:56.120
want to do I want my cars to go at all

0:37:53.300,0:38:00.010
different speeds so I'm gonna have like

0:37:56.120,0:38:04.490
one car go at twenty another car go at

0:38:00.010,0:38:07.430
like thirty and you can decide what good

0:38:04.490,0:38:09.230
speeds are but I like for my cars to

0:38:07.430,0:38:11.330
kind of go at all different speeds so I

0:38:09.230,0:38:14.090
just clicked on each car so my yellow

0:38:11.330,0:38:16.520
car I made him go twenty my orange car

0:38:14.090,0:38:19.790
he's my slow boo he's gonna go it how

0:38:16.520,0:38:22.190
many go super slow at ten my convertible

0:38:19.790,0:38:23.990
is at thirty and then my t-rex my top

0:38:22.190,0:38:25.610
one I for my top one would be the

0:38:23.990,0:38:27.650
fastest right that he's kind of like the

0:38:25.610,0:38:30.020
hardest challenge all right time to try

0:38:27.650,0:38:33.050
it I might have made it too hard right

0:38:30.020,0:38:34.580
so they're all at different speeds which

0:38:33.050,0:38:36.530
makes your game more interesting because

0:38:34.580,0:38:38.360
now their patterns are gonna like get

0:38:36.530,0:38:42.440
different see they don't all go together

0:38:38.360,0:38:43.910
right so I'm gonna try to get try to get

0:38:42.440,0:38:48.280
there I think here's a good Avenue to

0:38:43.910,0:38:53.650
get to the top yeah you win play again

0:38:48.280,0:38:53.650
cool so it looks like mine is working Oh

0:38:54.890,0:39:00.320
so the idea of these games is that you

0:38:57.410,0:39:03.200
get an opportunity to code and make a

0:39:00.320,0:39:05.510
game but it's also a fun way to play

0:39:03.200,0:39:07.430
your own game and make sure you have

0:39:05.510,0:39:09.490
