0:00:00.000,0:00:04.980
hey there welcome to the optional

0:00:01.860,0:00:07.620
exercise for today so this one I think

0:00:04.980,0:00:09.809
is a neat exercise but it's not really a

0:00:07.620,0:00:12.269
game so I didn't want to make it like

0:00:09.809,0:00:14.429
the main exercise for the day but it's a

0:00:12.269,0:00:16.289
really good way to learn about functions

0:00:14.429,0:00:18.630
and so what we're gonna do today is

0:00:16.289,0:00:21.050
we're going to practice making a drawing

0:00:18.630,0:00:23.160
so the drawing that we're gonna make is an 

0:00:21.050,0:00:25.680
American flag so hopefully you're familiar

0:00:23.160,0:00:27.869
with the American flag and the idea is

0:00:25.680,0:00:29.970
that we're gonna draw it using a couple

0:00:27.869,0:00:32.279
of different skills we're one gonna use

0:00:29.970,0:00:35.340
our drawing skills to just make

0:00:32.279,0:00:38.550
rectangles like the red rectangles for

0:00:35.340,0:00:41.489
the stripes and then a bigger blue

0:00:38.550,0:00:43.950
rectangle for the blue area but then

0:00:41.489,0:00:47.640
we're gonna use code with functions and

0:00:43.950,0:00:50.329
loops to make the to make the stars so

0:00:47.640,0:00:52.620
here you can see the stars are drawn on

0:00:50.329,0:00:54.480
to be honest with code you could draw

0:00:52.620,0:00:55.620
as fast or slow as you wanted so

0:00:54.480,0:00:57.300
if you wanted them to all just kind of

0:00:55.620,0:00:58.710
like show up you could but here I

0:00:57.300,0:01:00.030
put just like a short delay in there

0:00:58.710,0:01:02.489
just so you kind of like see them get

0:01:00.030,0:01:04.470
drawn on there and the idea is that

0:01:02.489,0:01:06.150
you're gonna make an American flag and

0:01:04.470,0:01:08.490
so it just a challenge of can you

0:01:06.150,0:01:10.200
can you actually figure up the code to

0:01:08.490,0:01:12.030
make this thing so it's not a game

0:01:10.200,0:01:12.840
there's nothing you do with the American

0:01:12.030,0:01:16.250
flag at the end

0:01:12.840,0:01:19.830
it is simply an artistic animation

0:01:16.250,0:01:21.750
putting the stars on here some things to

0:01:19.830,0:01:24.689
observe about the flag you'll notice

0:01:21.750,0:01:26.939
that there's 13 stripes total so that

0:01:24.689,0:01:29.340
means that there are seven that are red

0:01:26.939,0:01:32.189
it's on the top and bottom and then six

0:01:29.340,0:01:33.659
that are white my flag is not regulation

0:01:32.189,0:01:34.979
so for example you can see that like

0:01:33.659,0:01:36.600
this white is a little small that

0:01:34.979,0:01:36.900
white is a little big not worried about

0:01:36.600,0:01:39.329
it

0:01:36.900,0:01:42.630
right and then after that there's of

0:01:39.329,0:01:43.979
course 50 stars for the 50 states you

0:01:42.630,0:01:47.520
can see that if you kind of like count

0:01:43.979,0:01:50.729
the ones down this row there are five of

0:01:47.520,0:01:54.960
the long rows and the long rows have six

0:01:50.729,0:01:56.399
stars each so 5 times 6 is 30 and then

0:01:54.960,0:02:00.840
the short rows which start here there's

0:01:56.399,0:02:04.049
1 2 3 4 of those and there's 5 across so

0:02:00.840,0:02:07.079
4 times 5 is 20 and so that's how you

0:02:04.049,0:02:08.670
get the 50 stars so really I kind of

0:02:07.079,0:02:11.560
think of those two patterns as separate

0:02:08.670,0:02:13.330
there's the five that are six stars and

0:02:11.560,0:02:15.010
there's another grid where there's four

0:02:13.330,0:02:17.560
of them that are five stars and they

0:02:15.010,0:02:20.770
kind of overlay in such a way to make a

0:02:17.560,0:02:22.209
cool little diagonal pattern so that's

0:02:20.770,0:02:24.220
what we're gonna try to make if you'd

0:02:22.209,0:02:26.200
like to follow along I'd love to have

0:02:24.220,0:02:28.959
you and we're gonna learn some more

0:02:26.200,0:02:30.370
about functions as we do it so I'm gonna

0:02:28.959,0:02:32.709
come in here and say blank project I

0:02:30.370,0:02:35.470
finally just accepted the blank project is the

0:02:32.709,0:02:37.300
same as blank block coding project so

0:02:35.470,0:02:40.170
I'm just going to try it I click on

0:02:37.300,0:02:42.519
blank project living living dangerously

0:02:40.170,0:02:43.989
and the first thing I want to do is well

0:02:42.519,0:02:46.120
I don't need this actor so I'm just

0:02:43.989,0:02:49.720
gonna delete him

0:02:46.120,0:02:52.239
I want to make the stage right so I want

0:02:49.720,0:02:55.450
to just draw all the stage with 13

0:02:52.239,0:02:57.400
stripes 13 stars so I'm gonna click on the gear

0:02:55.450,0:03:00.370
here for the stage I'm gonna say add

0:02:57.400,0:03:03.569
background and I'm just gonna draw a new

0:03:00.370,0:03:09.150
background and so what I want to draw is

0:03:03.569,0:03:12.420
13 stripes 13s sorry 13 stripes 7 red

0:03:09.150,0:03:16.150
looks like I need to go a little smaller

0:03:12.420,0:03:18.100
make that go in a bit so 7 red stripes

0:03:16.150,0:03:20.440
and then the others will will just work

0:03:18.100,0:03:23.470
themselves off I now I want to make this

0:03:20.440,0:03:26.200
be some color but I kinda want to

0:03:23.470,0:03:28.329
make it be the right color right so I'm

0:03:26.200,0:03:31.299
just curious can I figure out by doing a

0:03:28.329,0:03:34.299
search for like what color the American

0:03:31.299,0:03:37.030
flag is Wikipedia I'm sure people use

0:03:34.299,0:03:39.160
Wikipedia plenty for searching I'll

0:03:37.030,0:03:41.049
find it for us but I just kind of wanted

0:03:39.160,0:03:42.430
to let you know where I'm going like if

0:03:41.049,0:03:44.440
you want to learn more about things

0:03:42.430,0:03:46.120
oh you've got all the specs here about

0:03:44.440,0:03:48.609
the official dimensions if you want to go 

0:03:46.120,0:03:50.230
crazy I'm really just worried about the

0:03:48.609,0:03:52.750
colors right so here's the area about

0:03:50.230,0:03:55.090
the colors so it looks like their red is

0:03:52.750,0:03:57.489
called Old Glory red did you know that I

0:03:55.090,0:04:02.290
didn't know that and here it has a hex

0:03:57.489,0:04:08.170
color right here so B 2 2 2 I'm just

0:04:02.290,0:04:09.850
gonna write this down B 2 2 2 3 4 and

0:04:08.170,0:04:11.859
then while I'm in here I might as well write down the

0:04:09.850,0:04:18.669
blue because I know I'm gonna need it

0:04:11.859,0:04:21.280
3 C 3 b 6 e now at this time your colors

0:04:18.669,0:04:23.470
will be the exact same as mine so you

0:04:21.280,0:04:25.520
could just wait until I type it right

0:04:23.470,0:04:28.250
so let's go ahead and start off by

0:04:25.520,0:04:30.319
making some red I chose to write down

0:04:28.250,0:04:35.539
and memorize the the hex version which

0:04:30.319,0:04:39.500
was B 2 2 2 3 4 and that is the official

0:04:35.539,0:04:41.870
Old Glory red which is the US flag

0:04:39.500,0:04:44.389
so that's kinda neat now what I want to do is I

0:04:41.870,0:04:46.729
want to make some rectangles and these

0:04:44.389,0:04:48.800
rectangles I always do that I always

0:04:46.729,0:04:52.370
make one on accident these rectangles I

0:04:48.800,0:04:54.349
want them to be roughly 4 tall and I want

0:04:52.370,0:04:56.840
one of them to kind of be like right on

0:04:54.349,0:04:58.430
the middle right so you can see if your

0:04:56.840,0:05:02.449
your eyes are just like amazingly

0:04:58.430,0:05:04.430
good you can see that's 1 2 3 roughly 4

0:05:02.449,0:05:07.280
tall and I'll just kind of make it about

0:05:04.430,0:05:08.930
that big and then what I'm gonna do

0:05:07.280,0:05:11.930
before I kind of let go of it I'm going

0:05:08.930,0:05:14.719
to a control C control V and that'll

0:05:11.930,0:05:16.580
kind of give me another rectangle and

0:05:14.719,0:05:19.909
I'm gonna move it up roughly the same

0:05:16.580,0:05:21.860
distance you know around that that four

0:05:19.909,0:05:23.529
blocks and then I always have to kind of

0:05:21.860,0:05:26.000
like stretch it over a little bit right

0:05:23.529,0:05:27.590
but I want it to extend the whole way so

0:05:26.000,0:05:29.569
actually I mean I guess you could put it

0:05:27.590,0:05:31.819
like you know way off to the side here

0:05:29.569,0:05:34.759
and then just stretch out the other one

0:05:31.819,0:05:36.529
that would work fine I suppose I should

0:05:34.759,0:05:38.870
be one on the very bottom and one on the

0:05:36.529,0:05:40.759
very top first now I'm happy to let you

0:05:38.870,0:05:43.969
draw your flag however you would like

0:05:40.759,0:05:46.909
right I'm just kind of like showing you

0:05:43.969,0:05:50.509
how I draw mine so the nice thing is I

0:05:46.909,0:05:54.440
just made one rectangle I hit control C

0:05:50.509,0:05:56.990
and then I just hit control V after each

0:05:54.440,0:05:58.729
time now I'm not worried about going

0:05:56.990,0:06:01.159
into that blue area because I'm just

0:05:58.729,0:06:04.819
gonna put a blue rectangle down on top

0:06:01.159,0:06:06.139
of it so I'm just gonna kind of spread

0:06:04.819,0:06:10.250
them all out here until I get something

0:06:06.139,0:06:14.539
kind of sort of mostly looks like 13

0:06:10.250,0:06:19.400
stripes see if I didn't get 1 2 3 4 5 6

0:06:14.539,0:06:23.120
7 8 9 10 11 12 13 I did good

0:06:19.400,0:06:25.520
so try yours if you need to pause the

0:06:23.120,0:06:28.339
video certainly do I can't imagine that

0:06:25.520,0:06:31.880
my pace is the same as your base this is

0:06:28.339,0:06:33.129
an optional extra so I do expect this to

0:06:31.880,0:06:35.139
be very difficult

0:06:33.129,0:06:37.029
for our younger audience but it's a neat

0:06:35.139,0:06:40.089
challenge if you would like to try to

0:06:37.029,0:06:44.969
try your hand at drawing an American

0:06:40.089,0:06:48.039
flag the next thing I need is I need a

0:06:44.969,0:06:49.839
area for the for the blue so we already

0:06:48.039,0:06:52.659
know what color the blue is and you can

0:06:49.839,0:06:54.369
kind of see that the blue goes down to

0:06:52.659,0:06:57.459
where the bottom of the blue is even

0:06:54.369,0:06:59.610
with the bottom of the red and it takes

0:06:57.459,0:07:02.169
up you know not a full half of the flag

0:06:59.610,0:07:03.659
but but you know near half like

0:07:02.169,0:07:05.529
definitely more than a third or fourth

0:07:03.659,0:07:07.089
and so that's what we're going to try to

0:07:05.529,0:07:09.939
do for the blue so for the blue I'm

0:07:07.089,0:07:11.979
gonna click on this little wheel I'm

0:07:09.939,0:07:15.939
gonna try to put in the correct hex

0:07:11.979,0:07:18.999
color for Old Glory I believe it was called

0:07:15.939,0:07:20.619
blue and what I have written down on my

0:07:18.999,0:07:25.360
sheet of paper is that right there so

0:07:20.619,0:07:27.399
that is official American flag blue and

0:07:25.360,0:07:30.519
now I'm gonna draw it to where there's

0:07:27.399,0:07:34.059
just a big blue rectangle that kind of

0:07:30.519,0:07:36.159
takes up this whole thing right cool

0:07:34.059,0:07:38.079
that doesn't look too bad maybe I

0:07:36.159,0:07:42.219
could've gone just a little wider even if you 

0:07:38.079,0:07:43.300
don't like it you can always just hit undo and

0:07:42.219,0:07:46.779
then you can just try it again

0:07:43.300,0:07:48.939
right so no no problems with undo as

0:07:46.779,0:07:50.709
many times you want so I'm gonna call

0:07:48.939,0:07:54.009
that good enough I made it just a little

0:07:50.709,0:07:55.300
bigger I think than what this one is but

0:07:54.009,0:07:56.769
that will just kind of give me a little

0:07:55.300,0:07:58.959
more room to draw so I just kind of

0:07:56.769,0:08:02.110
cheat a little in there and if I wanted

0:07:58.959,0:08:03.909
to edit it later I could doesn't doesn't

0:08:02.110,0:08:05.979
have to be perfect if yours this

0:08:03.909,0:08:09.399
a little smaller that's probably better

0:08:05.979,0:08:11.740
but this is the size that mine is so now

0:08:09.399,0:08:13.360
let's go back once you've got this draw

0:08:11.740,0:08:15.610
Oh actually if you want to this is

0:08:13.360,0:08:18.550
optional if you want to you can fill in

0:08:15.610,0:08:21.429
these spots with white it turns out that

0:08:18.550,0:08:22.990
if something's transparent in Tynker it

0:08:21.429,0:08:26.050
just shows through what's behind it and

0:08:22.990,0:08:27.550
there's white behind it by default so I

0:08:26.050,0:08:29.979
just kind of quickly filled them in with 

0:08:27.550,0:08:31.659
white I'm not worried about the the

0:08:29.979,0:08:33.669
little transparency that leaks

0:08:31.659,0:08:36.819
through this time because it should just

0:08:33.669,0:08:39.219
be white cool so now I should have a

0:08:36.819,0:08:40.930
nice cool stage it should look about like

0:08:39.219,0:08:42.710
that it looks like we got a minor

0:08:40.930,0:08:45.410
glitch at the top which I'm not

0:08:42.710,0:08:49.040
worried about it so now we're ready to

0:08:45.410,0:08:52.730
start in on drawing stars so I need an

0:08:49.040,0:08:54.320
actor now you may say what

0:08:52.730,0:08:56.270
actor did you use last time I didn't see

0:08:54.320,0:08:59.060
the actor usually it's like a cat or a

0:08:56.270,0:09:00.950
dog or a robot or something so the actor

0:08:59.060,0:09:04.640
this time is kind of funny I'm gonna

0:09:00.950,0:09:08.000
draw this actor this actor is invisible

0:09:04.640,0:09:10.250
right so invisible actors are the

0:09:08.000,0:09:13.370
easiest to draw because you don't draw

0:09:10.250,0:09:16.010
anything right and so now it's just it's

0:09:13.370,0:09:17.330
there see here there's my actor right

0:09:16.010,0:09:20.600
there I can see a little box around him

0:09:17.330,0:09:23.030
he is invisible awesome

0:09:20.600,0:09:26.540
and his name instead of actor I'm gonna

0:09:23.030,0:09:30.530
call him my pen right so he is he is my

0:09:26.540,0:09:32.330
pen so the first thing I want to do with

0:09:30.530,0:09:36.230
my pen oops I thought I changed his name

0:09:32.330,0:09:38.780
to pen he's my pen the first thing I

0:09:36.230,0:09:42.770
want to do with my pen is I want to

0:09:38.780,0:09:45.590
practice drawing stars so we're gonna do

0:09:42.770,0:09:47.480
this with functions right and this is a

0:09:45.590,0:09:49.600
good practice for what we've been doing

0:09:47.480,0:09:51.470
so you're gonna have to have an on start

0:09:49.600,0:09:53.780
because that's like where your codes

0:09:51.470,0:09:54.890
gonna run at when it starts but most of

0:09:53.780,0:09:56.870
the things we're gonna do are going to

0:09:54.890,0:09:58.550
be inside the functions so we're gonna

0:09:56.870,0:10:01.340
have to create a function so go to the

0:09:58.550,0:10:06.710
functions area and say create function and make

0:10:01.340,0:10:08.780
a function called draw star so draw star

0:10:06.710,0:10:10.550
is going to take no parameters they

0:10:08.780,0:10:12.470
should make a little stub like this for

0:10:10.550,0:10:15.980
you but what its gonna do is it's gonna

0:10:12.470,0:10:17.660
put the pen down draw the star and then

0:10:15.980,0:10:20.480
pick the pen back up and it's gonna like

0:10:17.660,0:10:21.800
use a marker and you're like the pen

0:10:20.480,0:10:24.200
what's he talking about put the pen down

0:10:21.800,0:10:25.850
put the pen up there's actually more

0:10:24.200,0:10:28.040
commands than what you see here so

0:10:25.850,0:10:29.570
there's these commands which are all

0:10:28.040,0:10:31.190
well and good but there's actually even

0:10:29.570,0:10:36.110
more see this more button down here click 

0:10:31.190,0:10:38.480
on more so these are more commands that

0:10:36.110,0:10:40.520
you don't even necessarily know exist

0:10:38.480,0:10:44.540
right and the one that we want this time

0:10:40.520,0:10:46.610
is called pen cool so that one's going

0:10:44.540,0:10:48.500
to be gonna be available to us now so

0:10:46.610,0:10:50.060
the pen lets us kind of do some marking

0:10:48.500,0:10:53.330
so now you can see that I've got this

0:10:50.060,0:10:55.700
pen category so I want to do a couple

0:10:53.330,0:10:55.820
things with my pen so one thing I want

0:10:55.700,0:10:59.600
to

0:10:55.820,0:11:02.510
do is when the program starts I want to

0:10:59.600,0:11:04.610
clear off any old pen markings right so

0:11:02.510,0:11:06.380
I just kind of it clear them off I'd

0:11:04.610,0:11:09.020
also like to set up my pen I'd like

0:11:06.380,0:11:11.240
to like set its size and its color so

0:11:09.020,0:11:12.610
this is kind of like picking the marker

0:11:11.240,0:11:17.450
out of the drawer that you want to use

0:11:12.610,0:11:20.120
so we want set pen size I'm gonna use

0:11:17.450,0:11:21.920
five for mine if you want a bigger pen

0:11:20.120,0:11:24.350
you could use like up to ten that'd be fine

0:11:21.920,0:11:25.160
but one is kind of too small and one

0:11:24.350,0:11:28.460
is the default

0:11:25.160,0:11:30.740
I'm gonna set the color the color that

0:11:28.460,0:11:33.440
I'm going to use is just all f's that's

0:11:30.740,0:11:35.630
that's white so pretend like what this

0:11:33.440,0:11:38.060
does is this erases your current drawing

0:11:35.630,0:11:41.030
and then it goes and gets a white marker

0:11:38.060,0:11:43.880
it's kind of a medium size of five out

0:11:41.030,0:11:46.280
of your drawer and then what I'm gonna

0:11:43.880,0:11:49.370
do is I'm going to go to functions I'm

0:11:46.280,0:11:52.190
gonna say draw star so just wherever

0:11:49.370,0:11:54.980
you're at maybe it's right here just

0:11:52.190,0:11:56.840
draw a star for me now I could run that

0:11:54.980,0:11:58.880
code but it doesn't do anything cuz it

0:11:56.840,0:12:00.950
does this and then it calls draw star

0:11:58.880,0:12:03.710
and draw star is empty so we're gonna

0:12:00.950,0:12:05.900
have to draw a star so let's go ahead

0:12:03.710,0:12:07.580
and draw a star so here's how draw

0:12:05.900,0:12:09.340
star works well the first thing we need

0:12:07.580,0:12:11.660
to do is we need to put the pen down and

0:12:09.340,0:12:12.950
then we're gonna do some drawing and

0:12:11.660,0:12:14.960
then we're gonna pick the pin back up

0:12:12.950,0:12:16.460
and the reason we pick it back up is so

0:12:14.960,0:12:18.530
that we can hop over to the next star

0:12:16.460,0:12:20.900
without like leaving a line right so

0:12:18.530,0:12:23.150
our drawing is gonna be like in here so

0:12:20.900,0:12:26.690
let's talk about how you might draw a

0:12:23.150,0:12:31.030
star so I'm gonna go to control so this

0:12:26.690,0:12:33.800
is a good opportunity for loops so a

0:12:31.030,0:12:36.560
star let's draw a square first and maybe

0:12:33.800,0:12:40.720
a triangle next right so a star is

0:12:36.560,0:12:43.580
really a series of movements turns

0:12:40.720,0:12:46.400
movements turns repeated over and over

0:12:43.580,0:12:47.960
so everything I said there was a

0:12:46.400,0:12:50.510
movement either it's a movement or turn

0:12:47.960,0:12:53.930
so let's try to see if we could draw a

0:12:50.510,0:12:59.210
square so maybe we'll say move 100 for

0:12:53.930,0:13:02.420
our square and then if it's a square we

0:12:59.210,0:13:06.620
need to turn some number of degrees so a

0:13:02.420,0:13:07.880
square would be a 90-degree turn and we

0:13:06.620,0:13:10.430
would need four of 

0:13:07.880,0:13:12.500
these things to draw a square so if I

0:13:10.430,0:13:13.220
were to run this code it would draw a

0:13:12.500,0:13:16.149
square

0:13:13.220,0:13:18.980
now it drew it really fast which is fine

0:13:16.149,0:13:21.500
it just like almost appeared right if

0:13:18.980,0:13:23.029
you wanted to see each side like like

0:13:21.500,0:13:24.380
what it's doing as it goes this is

0:13:23.029,0:13:27.259
optional you can just watch this

0:13:24.380,0:13:29.750
you can put in a delay after each one

0:13:27.259,0:13:31.550
right so here we draw that side and

0:13:29.750,0:13:33.620
then that side and that side and that

0:13:31.550,0:13:37.339
side if you wanted to do that that'd be

0:13:33.620,0:13:41.089
fine let's break down how these numbers

0:13:37.339,0:13:44.389
got here so four is how many sides you

0:13:41.089,0:13:47.509
want 100 is the length of course of each

0:13:44.389,0:13:50.569
side and 90 90 is interesting how'd this

0:13:47.509,0:13:52.130
90 get here so maybe you just know that

0:13:50.569,0:13:54.410
in order to make a square you have to

0:13:52.130,0:13:56.899
do a 90 degree turn but the way it got

0:13:54.410,0:13:58.910
there is interesting so if you look at

0:13:56.899,0:14:02.420
how many degrees there are in a circle

0:13:58.910,0:14:05.930
total so does anybody know that's where I

0:14:02.420,0:14:10.519
wish my kids were here there's 360 right

0:14:05.930,0:14:13.009
and 90 is what a square is because 90 if

0:14:10.519,0:14:14.529
you're good at division there's 360

0:14:13.009,0:14:18.069
that's all the way around the circle

0:14:14.529,0:14:20.480
divided by or how many sides there are

0:14:18.069,0:14:23.120
so let's do something that seems a

0:14:20.480,0:14:25.459
little crazy at first let's instead of

0:14:23.120,0:14:30.589
just writing 90 let's put in that math

0:14:25.459,0:14:32.480
problem right so operators so that math

0:14:30.589,0:14:34.490
problem was a division math problem that

0:14:32.480,0:14:36.139
I just did so I'm gonna take division and

0:14:34.490,0:14:42.259
drop it in here and that math problem

0:14:36.139,0:14:45.759
was really 360 divided by 4 and so that

0:14:42.259,0:14:49.009
is the same thing it draws the square

0:14:45.759,0:14:50.990
now if I wanted to draw a triangle what

0:14:49.009,0:14:54.560
I would do is actually pretty similar I

0:14:50.990,0:14:57.560
would change it to three sides and I

0:14:54.560,0:14:58.819
would change this to three and what that

0:14:57.560,0:15:00.470
would do is that would draw a triangle

0:14:58.819,0:15:03.709
hey that's pretty cool

0:15:00.470,0:15:08.779
if I wanted to draw a hexagon I would

0:15:03.709,0:15:11.360
say repeat 6 times 360 divided by 6 and

0:15:08.779,0:15:13.910
so that would draw a hexagon hey that's

0:15:11.360,0:15:16.130
pretty cool um so now how do we draw a 

0:15:13.910,0:15:19.189
star right so star is a little

0:15:16.130,0:15:21.680
different because if I put in five cuz

0:15:19.189,0:15:25.460
the star has five points right

0:15:21.680,0:15:29.149
and I hit play it doesn't make a star it

0:15:25.460,0:15:32.600
makes a pentagon oh shoot I don't want

0:15:29.149,0:15:34.940
a Pentagon I want a star so a star is

0:15:32.600,0:15:41.149
interesting if you actually like go look

0:15:34.940,0:15:43.370
at a star so star a star has a iTunes

0:15:41.149,0:15:46.160
star apparently I don't want that fine

0:15:43.370,0:15:49.220
I'll just think about a star a star goes

0:15:46.160,0:15:52.220
over and then turns a lot before it goes

0:15:49.220,0:15:53.839
down then turns a lot and goes up and it

0:15:52.220,0:15:56.230
turns a lot and goes down it comes a lot

0:15:53.839,0:16:01.040
and goes up it actually does instead of

0:15:56.230,0:16:04.580
360 degrees it does two laps and so it

0:16:01.040,0:16:06.529
does 360 times two is really what it

0:16:04.580,0:16:08.720
does now it won't let you do math like

0:16:06.529,0:16:14.029
this inside these boxes so I'm just

0:16:08.720,0:16:15.680
gonna do it for you it's 720 right so

0:16:14.029,0:16:19.100
this is crazy but if you want to make a

0:16:15.680,0:16:22.430
star a pentagon does 360 in the five

0:16:19.100,0:16:24.560
points and what a star does is a star

0:16:22.430,0:16:28.220
does two laps

0:16:24.560,0:16:31.010
so it's 720 and five points it's kind of

0:16:28.220,0:16:35.510
neat to see to see different numbers of

0:16:31.010,0:16:38.029
points attempted by the way so here is a

0:16:35.510,0:16:41.320
triangle but with two laps it didn't

0:16:38.029,0:16:44.720
actually do anything interesting here is

0:16:41.320,0:16:47.390
sorry that was a six-sided thing you can

0:16:44.720,0:16:49.730
try and make a seven sided thing which

0:16:47.390,0:16:51.740
is kind of crazy and it makes some

0:16:49.730,0:16:53.750
interesting patterns and shapes right

0:16:51.740,0:16:56.390
but only some of them come out to be

0:16:53.750,0:16:58.940
cool but a star obviously is a cool one

0:16:56.390,0:17:00.680
I mentioned things like that because

0:16:58.940,0:17:02.810
it's fun to just play all right it's fun

0:17:00.680,0:17:04.189
to just play with things and so there

0:17:02.810,0:17:08.480
we've actually made a function which

0:17:04.189,0:17:11.300
calls a star I like this one second for

0:17:08.480,0:17:13.429
testing but it's going to be too slow in

0:17:11.300,0:17:17.860
the end so I'm going to take this off I

0:17:13.429,0:17:22.130
mean maybe I would add like some delay

0:17:17.860,0:17:26.030
at the end once I kind of like finish

0:17:22.130,0:17:27.679
this code but to be honest even that for

0:17:26.030,0:17:30.230
testing might be kind of painful right

0:17:27.679,0:17:31.690
so the this if I add it to the end it'll

0:17:30.230,0:17:33.160
kind of make some animated effect

0:17:31.690,0:17:36.670
I'll tell you what I'll leave it on

0:17:33.160,0:17:39.730
there till it's painful so now we've

0:17:36.670,0:17:42.400
drawn one flag or one star that star

0:17:39.730,0:17:45.400
could of course be huge if we change it

0:17:42.400,0:17:46.990
to be 200 it draws a big star if you

0:17:45.400,0:17:47.890
would like to make it really big you can

0:17:46.990,0:17:50.980
make it 300

0:17:47.890,0:17:53.620
it's a giant star we need to make it

0:17:50.980,0:17:55.540
much smaller if we're going to put 50 of

0:17:53.620,0:17:58.390
these things on here and I know that

0:17:55.540,0:18:04.750
this seems really small but try putting

0:17:58.390,0:18:06.520
it at 25 pixels so quite small cool so I

0:18:04.750,0:18:10.560
think this is good enough that I should

0:18:06.520,0:18:13.420
save it so I'm going to call it US flag

0:18:10.560,0:18:18.730
and I'm gonna hit save

0:18:13.420,0:18:22.840
so this is an optional extra for day 5

0:18:18.730,0:18:24.460
week 1 by the way thanks for coming

0:18:22.840,0:18:27.610
to do the optional extra

0:18:24.460,0:18:28.540
maybe I should even spell optional

0:18:27.610,0:18:33.040
correctly

0:18:28.540,0:18:34.860
optional extra for day 5 week 1 so now what we want to do

0:18:33.040,0:18:38.770
is we don't want to make just one star

0:18:34.860,0:18:41.170
we want to modify our code such that it

0:18:38.770,0:18:43.840
draws not just one I'll tell you what I'll just put that in 

0:18:41.170,0:18:47.890
the trash but we want to draw a row of

0:18:43.840,0:18:50.590
stars and that ability to draw a roll of

0:18:47.890,0:18:52.000
stars is very powerful and if you think

0:18:50.590,0:18:54.130
about our solution what we're really

0:18:52.000,0:18:58.210
doing here is we're drawing rows of

0:18:54.130,0:19:00.010
stars where this one has six and then

0:18:58.210,0:19:02.320
this one has five and then this one has

0:19:00.010,0:19:05.140
six and this one has five we're doing that

0:19:02.320,0:19:07.180
over and over from different spots right

0:19:05.140,0:19:08.650
so this one started from here this one

0:19:07.180,0:19:11.200
started from here this one started from

0:19:08.650,0:19:13.900
here but only did five so if we had a

0:19:11.200,0:19:15.670
function that could help us we'd have to

0:19:13.900,0:19:17.500
look at what's different each time and

0:19:15.670,0:19:19.230
what's the same so the things that are

0:19:17.500,0:19:22.420
different is where you start your X

0:19:19.230,0:19:24.370
where you start your Y and how many

0:19:22.420,0:19:25.990
there are so what we're gonna do is we're

0:19:24.370,0:19:27.550
going to show you a really powerful use

0:19:25.990,0:19:30.190
of functions so let's go into functions

0:19:27.550,0:19:35.260
and make our most advanced function ever

0:19:30.190,0:19:37.060
called row of stars and it's our most

0:19:35.260,0:19:39.910
advanced function ever because it's

0:19:37.060,0:19:42.160
gonna receive parameters I'm gonna go

0:19:39.910,0:19:43.140
ahead and put them in first number of

0:19:42.160,0:19:48.210
stars

0:19:43.140,0:19:51.240
so our function row of stars is going to

0:19:48.210,0:19:52.380
receive three things so when you call

0:19:51.240,0:19:55.320
this function you're going to tell it

0:19:52.380,0:19:57.480
these three things right and if you tell

0:19:55.320,0:19:59.760
it these three things the X and the y

0:19:57.480,0:20:00.299
for where to start and how many stars

0:19:59.760,0:20:03.320
you want

0:20:00.299,0:20:05.760
then it can create a row of them for you

0:20:03.320,0:20:10.100
it's getting pretty advanced I know but it's

0:20:05.760,0:20:12.630
cool and so to create a row of stars

0:20:10.100,0:20:16.860
what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're

0:20:12.630,0:20:18.929
gonna call draw star that many times and

0:20:16.860,0:20:19.500
we're gonna move between each one does that

0:20:18.929,0:20:22.169
makes sense

0:20:19.500,0:20:24.090
and we want it to start at this x and y

0:20:22.169,0:20:25.500
so let's go ahead and write this

0:20:24.090,0:20:27.809
function together maybe I'll move it up

0:20:25.500,0:20:29.309
here so you can see it a little better so the first

0:20:27.809,0:20:31.350
thing I want to do is if somebody told

0:20:29.309,0:20:33.210
me to start at this location the first

0:20:31.350,0:20:36.960
thing I have to do is I have to tell my

0:20:33.210,0:20:43.350
actor my pen to go to that location go

0:20:36.960,0:20:47.010
to that location is in motion so go to X 0

0:20:43.350,0:20:49.230
Y 0 now I don't want to go to X 0 Y 0 I

0:20:47.010,0:20:51.240
want to go to X&Y now this is

0:20:49.230,0:20:52.919
interesting those are variables but they

0:20:51.240,0:20:55.500
don't show up in this variables area

0:20:52.919,0:20:57.510
they show up right up here and so you

0:20:55.500,0:20:59.940
literally just drag it from there to

0:20:57.510,0:21:01.799
here it's called a local variable for

0:20:59.940,0:21:03.840
the function and dragging it from here to 

0:21:01.799,0:21:05.400
there so when somebody calls this

0:21:03.840,0:21:09.299
function the first thing I do is I tell

0:21:05.400,0:21:11.850
my actor my pen go to that X Y that they

0:21:09.299,0:21:13.950
asked for right the next thing I want to

0:21:11.850,0:21:15.360
do is I wanna make a loop so I'm going

0:21:13.950,0:21:20.490
to go to operator oh no I'm sorry

0:21:15.360,0:21:22.860
control and I want to make a loop and

0:21:20.490,0:21:26.010
what its gonna do inside of it is it's

0:21:22.860,0:21:28.350
gonna run this loop number of stars times so you

0:21:26.010,0:21:30.120
can see how I'm using those things that

0:21:28.350,0:21:32.250
got passed in here so it's gonna run

0:21:30.120,0:21:33.600
number of stars times and what it's going to

0:21:32.250,0:21:36.179
do in the inside is it's gonna draw a

0:21:33.600,0:21:39.750
star and then it's gonna move over some

0:21:36.179,0:21:42.929
amount so I've got to use my my function

0:21:39.750,0:21:45.320
that I made called draw a star so I'm

0:21:42.929,0:21:48.480
gonna stick to draw a star in there and

0:21:45.320,0:21:52.050
then I want to move over after that and

0:21:48.480,0:21:55.410
that move over won't be visible to the

0:21:52.050,0:21:58.020
user because draw a star has picked the

0:21:55.410,0:22:00.480
pen up at the end right so let's go

0:21:58.020,0:22:02.040
ahead and say we're going to move over a

0:22:00.480,0:22:03.930
hundred pixels that's a nice round

0:22:02.040,0:22:06.210
number if it turns out that I need to

0:22:03.930,0:22:09.420
make it a little bigger or a little

0:22:06.210,0:22:11.370
smaller I'll figure that out great

0:22:09.420,0:22:13.140
so now I've got they make it so they can't 

0:22:11.370,0:22:14.910
overlap and run away

0:22:13.140,0:22:17.370
from each other so now I've got a

0:22:14.910,0:22:18.780
function and another function that it

0:22:17.370,0:22:20.520
calls and I playing around trying to

0:22:18.780,0:22:23.910
move them to where they look good on the

0:22:20.520,0:22:26.790
screen together but I don't actually in

0:22:23.910,0:22:29.400
my main code call this yet so I need to

0:22:26.790,0:22:31.170
call that so you'll notice that now I've

0:22:29.400,0:22:33.810
got this new block which receives

0:22:31.170,0:22:35.280
arguments it's interesting that

0:22:33.810,0:22:36.810
receiving arguments is something we've

0:22:35.280,0:22:38.220
been doing for ages

0:22:36.810,0:22:39.690
you just haven't thought about it right

0:22:38.220,0:22:42.450
it's just now we're making our own

0:22:39.690,0:22:44.640
function that receives arguments and so

0:22:42.450,0:22:47.460
now I'm going to start drawing this

0:22:44.640,0:22:52.130
thing so I'm going to go with the upper

0:22:47.460,0:22:54.690
left corner which is roughly negative

0:22:52.130,0:22:57.720
653 48 that's roughly the right place

0:22:54.690,0:22:59.400
and I'm going to draw six stars and so

0:22:57.720,0:23:02.010
what should happen is my code will

0:22:59.400,0:23:05.100
select my pen then it'll call this

0:23:02.010,0:23:07.110
function moving the actor to that

0:23:05.100,0:23:09.870
starting location and then it's going to

0:23:07.110,0:23:12.990
draw six stars kind of drawing it moving

0:23:09.870,0:23:13.500
drawing it moving right and that looks

0:23:12.990,0:23:19.230
pretty good

0:23:13.500,0:23:22.380
right so if anything my 100 needs to be

0:23:19.230,0:23:24.090
a little less I could do a little less

0:23:22.380,0:23:26.100
or actually you know another thing I

0:23:24.090,0:23:29.040
could do I could just go in and I could

0:23:26.100,0:23:30.960
make my green flag or sorry the blue

0:23:29.040,0:23:33.210
on my flag just a little bigger that way

0:23:30.960,0:23:33.870
I could keep my 100 because it's a nice

0:23:33.210,0:23:35.910
round number

0:23:33.870,0:23:37.920
and I just modify my flag a little bit

0:23:35.910,0:23:40.830
what the heck I'll do that so I'm gonna

0:23:37.920,0:23:46.140
eyedropper this guy and I'm just going

0:23:40.830,0:23:48.000
to extend it just a scooch and you know

0:23:46.140,0:23:49.800
you can play with it until it kind of

0:23:48.000,0:23:52.220
looks like it was part of there part of

0:23:49.800,0:23:54.590
the thing all along

0:23:52.220,0:23:57.540
all right cool there we go so I 

0:23:54.590,0:23:59.880
modified my blue a little bit just so I

0:23:57.540,0:24:03.000
could use nice nice even numbers so I

0:23:59.880,0:24:04.800
use 25 for the size of the stars and

0:24:03.000,0:24:06.840
those look about right and a hundred

0:24:04.800,0:24:07.590
between each one those look about

0:24:06.840,0:24:10.410
right

0:24:07.590,0:24:12.450
now my 348 isn't a very even number I

0:24:10.410,0:24:14.880
wonder if 350 would look good enough

0:24:12.450,0:24:19.200
right so now if I run it

0:24:14.880,0:24:21.270
yeah 350 is good enough but I don't it

0:24:19.200,0:24:23.790
doesn't matter if yours is perfect or

0:24:21.270,0:24:25.520
not but you know try to try to pick

0:24:23.790,0:24:27.870
something that kind of looks good

0:24:25.520,0:24:29.910
the next thing I wouldn't mind doing is

0:24:27.870,0:24:32.670
trying to figure up where the bottom

0:24:29.910,0:24:35.790
row is I know that seems a little silly

0:24:32.670,0:24:38.160
but if I do the top and the bottom then

0:24:35.790,0:24:42.810
I can kind of figure up where the others

0:24:38.160,0:24:46.020
are at so I'm gonna guess based on some

0:24:42.810,0:24:48.480
work I've done previously 25 for the Y

0:24:46.020,0:24:50.760
and see how that works and then I'm just

0:24:48.480,0:24:53.150
gonna move it after that so I'd say that

0:24:50.760,0:24:56.460
that looks pretty good right so it's not

0:24:53.150,0:24:59.220
not perfect but I'd say it's good enough

0:24:56.460,0:25:01.620
it's a nice round number being 25 I

0:24:59.220,0:25:03.720
guess if I could go a little lower I could see what 0

0:25:01.620,0:25:05.910
looks like what does zero look like eh

0:25:03.720,0:25:10.580
zeros a little too low

0:25:05.910,0:25:13.800
I'll stick with I'll stick with 20 why not

0:25:10.580,0:25:16.290
and so from here what I want to do is I

0:25:13.800,0:25:19.860
want to challenge you to see if you can

0:25:16.290,0:25:24.360
figure out the rest by yourself right so

0:25:19.860,0:25:27.360
see if you can figure up where all the

0:25:24.360,0:25:28.910
the rows of six need to go so you know

0:25:27.360,0:25:31.140
there's probably one that needs to be

0:25:28.910,0:25:33.480
you know kind of right between these two

0:25:31.140,0:25:36.480
if you want to do the math like you know

0:25:33.480,0:25:38.640
with an adult you could try to figure

0:25:36.480,0:25:39.690
up where they're where they're at if

0:25:38.640,0:25:42.420
you don't want to do the math in your

0:25:39.690,0:25:46.470
head you can also use Google to help you

0:25:42.420,0:25:47.820
out so for example if I did 350 plus 20

0:25:46.470,0:25:50.880
divided by 2

0:25:47.820,0:25:54.960
well 350 plus 20 divided by 2 is 185

0:25:50.880,0:25:56.730
right and so for mine I've got 185 and

0:25:54.960,0:25:59.130
so if you wanted to try to figure it out

0:25:56.730,0:26:01.350
that would be great but if you want to

0:25:59.130,0:26:03.420
you can just pause the video and do that

0:26:01.350,0:26:06.960
or just keep watching and I'll show you

0:26:03.420,0:26:09.030
all the values that I used all right if

0:26:06.960,0:26:10.830
you paused it maybe you worked at

0:26:09.030,0:26:13.560
yourself but I think I've got my groups

0:26:10.830,0:26:15.720
of 6 together so the order I did is I

0:26:13.560,0:26:17.340
did the top then I did the bottom then I

0:26:15.720,0:26:18.540
did the middle but I found out its 

0:26:17.340,0:26:18.820
the middle of those and the middle of

0:26:18.540,0:26:21.730
those two

0:26:18.820,0:26:24.429
and then just to make it kind of like

0:26:21.730,0:26:27.519
display better I'm going to reorder them

0:26:24.429,0:26:31.570
now so that it looks like I actually coded

0:26:27.519,0:26:34.289
them in top-to-bottom order right so

0:26:31.570,0:26:37.710
there is all the different groups of six

0:26:34.289,0:26:41.860
now again see if you can pause the video

0:26:37.710,0:26:45.820
but see if you can make the groups of

0:26:41.860,0:26:47.980
five so the groups of five are all going

0:26:45.820,0:26:51.190
to start moved over a little bit so

0:26:47.980,0:26:53.620
let's see if this moves over a hundred

0:26:51.190,0:26:55.149
then the first one's gonna have to move

0:26:53.620,0:26:56.950
over fifty so I can tell you that

0:26:55.149,0:26:59.559
they're going to be starting it like

0:26:56.950,0:27:00.399
negative six hundred and then you just

0:26:59.559,0:27:02.259
kind of need to figure out what's

0:27:00.399,0:27:04.840
halfway between those two I know that

0:27:02.259,0:27:07.809
getting the math perfect is is a giant

0:27:04.840,0:27:09.759
pain but the nice thing about this one

0:27:07.809,0:27:13.360
is you're only gonna have four them

0:27:09.759,0:27:14.919
right so go and connect that there so

0:27:13.360,0:27:16.960
they obviously don't all belong to

0:27:14.919,0:27:19.539
twenty but see if you can figure up

0:27:16.960,0:27:21.100
where they're all at on your own then

0:27:19.539,0:27:23.139
kind of go halfway between each of these

0:27:21.100,0:27:24.610
and if you can figure it out great if

0:27:23.139,0:27:28.000
not just pause the video and I'll show

0:27:24.610,0:27:31.779
you mine in a second all right so I went

0:27:28.000,0:27:33.970
through and I added the the halves of

0:27:31.779,0:27:36.970
those and so I kind of put them in those

0:27:33.970,0:27:38.940
in those spots again if you if you felt

0:27:36.970,0:27:41.919
the urge you know you could reorder them

0:27:38.940,0:27:44.320
to where they're kind of like appearing

0:27:41.919,0:27:46.149
to go from top to bottom right so it

0:27:44.320,0:27:47.860
does like a six and then a five and then

0:27:46.149,0:27:50.710
a six and then a five and then a six and then a 

0:27:47.860,0:27:54.120
five so six five six five six five six

0:27:50.710,0:27:57.940
five six five and that makes your

0:27:54.120,0:28:01.029
animation kind of look cooler right so

0:27:57.940,0:28:03.549
again I better do one full screen again

0:28:01.029,0:28:06.009
this is not actually a game this is a

0:28:03.549,0:28:08.590
good learning opportunity because we

0:28:06.009,0:28:11.620
learned about functions we learned about

0:28:08.590,0:28:13.960
function parameters and we learned how you

0:28:11.620,0:28:16.929
can kind of like make some art there's

0:28:13.960,0:28:19.120
actually a ton of things you can do with

0:28:16.929,0:28:22.059
making art I just thought that this one

0:28:19.120,0:28:24.519
was a really neat challenge it is a

0:28:22.059,0:28:27.010
little too hard admittedly which is why

0:28:24.519,0:28:29.440
it's an optional extra I use it

0:28:27.010,0:28:32.920
sometimes with middle schoolers as a math lesson 

0:28:29.440,0:28:35.020
for like doing averages but that's okay

0:28:32.920,0:28:38.080
