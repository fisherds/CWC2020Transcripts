[Music]

0:00:03.890,0:00:08.250
hey welcome back today is day two the

0:00:06.810,0:00:10.500
tinkerer can't what we're going to be

0:00:08.250,0:00:12.090
working on today is building on the

0:00:10.500,0:00:14.280
skills that we got yesterday so we're

0:00:12.090,0:00:15.960
gonna continue to work with variables to

0:00:14.280,0:00:17.520
get better with tinker and today we're

0:00:15.960,0:00:18.810
gonna do some things with drawing it's

0:00:17.520,0:00:20.970
kind of one of the skills that we worry

0:00:18.810,0:00:22.680
about now whenever I say hey the skill

0:00:20.970,0:00:25.380
for today is drawing people are like hey

0:00:22.680,0:00:28.199
that's not coding but it is right so

0:00:25.380,0:00:30.689
coding creating apps creating projects

0:00:28.199,0:00:33.270
there's a lot of design emerges really

0:00:30.689,0:00:34.350
well with art and music and so today one

0:00:33.270,0:00:36.030
of the main things we're doing is

0:00:34.350,0:00:38.160
working our drawing we're stuck in the

0:00:36.030,0:00:40.500
right code too so here's the game that

0:00:38.160,0:00:43.320
we're gonna make so we're gonna make a

0:00:40.500,0:00:45.090
game it's called Treasure Island you can

0:00:43.320,0:00:46.680
kinda love whatever you want but the

0:00:45.090,0:00:49.950
idea of Treasure Island is that your

0:00:46.680,0:00:51.809
boat chases your mouse and you're trying

0:00:49.950,0:00:55.710
to successfully get to the treasure

0:00:51.809,0:00:58.530
if you succeed it'll say you win but

0:00:55.710,0:01:00.120
then it'll say let's go faster right and

0:00:58.530,0:01:01.770
then what we're doing is if you watch

0:01:00.120,0:01:04.170
the variable in the corner see where it

0:01:01.770,0:01:08.100
says speed 20 up there watch what

0:01:04.170,0:01:11.100
happens if I went again it says speed 40

0:01:08.100,0:01:13.890
and so our speed which is our variable I

0:01:11.100,0:01:16.979
gets fast for each time and then if you

0:01:13.890,0:01:18.869
do hit an island it'll say you wrecked

0:01:16.979,0:01:20.340
your ship and that will be the game over

0:01:18.869,0:01:22.140
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna

0:01:20.340,0:01:25.380
make this together you wrecked your ship

0:01:22.140,0:01:27.990
and then you're challenged for today if

0:01:25.380,0:01:30.150
you like a challenge is to build the

0:01:27.990,0:01:32.990
same concept so you're gonna build

0:01:30.150,0:01:36.450
another game which also has this like

0:01:32.990,0:01:38.579
your actor follows your ship here it is

0:01:36.450,0:01:40.650
the ship again here he's trying to get

0:01:38.579,0:01:42.780
home so you made at home and then of

0:01:40.650,0:01:44.340
course it says let's go faster so I

0:01:42.780,0:01:46.380
think that's the that's the idea and

0:01:44.340,0:01:47.549
then if you wreck it does that so that's

0:01:46.380,0:01:49.950
what we're trying to build today we're

0:01:47.549,0:01:52.439
gonna work on drawing variables and

0:01:49.950,0:01:54.990
doing more code so go ahead and go to

0:01:52.439,0:01:58.140
your projects and click on create new

0:01:54.990,0:02:02.610
project and of course what we want is we

0:01:58.140,0:02:04.259
want a blank block coding project so I

0:02:02.610,0:02:06.840
always click on block coding and go down

0:02:04.259,0:02:08.520
here now if you were to click blank

0:02:06.840,0:02:11.009
project up here I think it's the exact

0:02:08.520,0:02:13.200
same as blank block coding project but

0:02:11.009,0:02:13.710
I'm gonna go ahead and say blank block

0:02:13.200,0:02:15.330
coding

0:02:13.710,0:02:18.120
project I just because that is

0:02:15.330,0:02:19.860
definitely what we're making so the

0:02:18.120,0:02:22.590
first thing we want to do we've kind of

0:02:19.860,0:02:24.420
got ourselves set up here we if you

0:02:22.590,0:02:25.800
remember don't need a monster in this

0:02:24.420,0:02:28.290
one so the first thing I'm gonna do is

0:02:25.800,0:02:29.790
I'm going to delete my monster I saw I'm

0:02:28.290,0:02:34.350
gonna click on these little three dots

0:02:29.790,0:02:36.060
over here and say delete and it'll say

0:02:34.350,0:02:38.130
you sure you want to delete actor

0:02:36.060,0:02:39.540
because he is an actor and his name is

0:02:38.130,0:02:42.570
actor so I'm going to delete him and

0:02:39.540,0:02:45.270
then what I want to do instead is I want

0:02:42.570,0:02:49.230
to have a pirate ship so I'm going to

0:02:45.270,0:02:51.000
click on add actor whenever you're

0:02:49.230,0:02:53.430
adding an actor you could just draw the

0:02:51.000,0:02:54.960
actor if you wanted you could do these

0:02:53.430,0:02:56.760
special character builders like our

0:02:54.960,0:02:58.350
monster had these special features but

0:02:56.760,0:03:00.090
normally what we do is we just go to the

0:02:58.350,0:03:04.770
media library so go ahead and click on

0:03:00.090,0:03:07.710
media library and then what we're doing

0:03:04.770,0:03:10.140
is we're looking for the pirate ship is

0:03:07.710,0:03:11.580
the one that I'm after you could use a

0:03:10.140,0:03:14.400
different one but make sure it's some

0:03:11.580,0:03:15.780
type of like vessel that moves right so

0:03:14.400,0:03:19.950
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look for

0:03:15.780,0:03:24.510
ship in the search bar and I'm gonna see

0:03:19.950,0:03:26.190
what comes up so you can pick a

0:03:24.510,0:03:28.440
different thing if you'd like you could

0:03:26.190,0:03:31.230
use an alien ship in the water or a

0:03:28.440,0:03:33.210
spaceship if you'd like but I think that

0:03:31.230,0:03:35.310
one of these ships like the pirate ship

0:03:33.210,0:03:36.960
this pirate ship the Viking boat or the

0:03:35.310,0:03:39.090
trading ship are gonna fit best

0:03:36.960,0:03:42.680
thematically from my game so I'm gonna

0:03:39.090,0:03:42.680
go ahead and just click on pirate ship

0:03:42.740,0:03:50.880
so what that does is that adds an actor

0:03:47.850,0:03:53.130
to your to your game right so we've got

0:03:50.880,0:03:55.470
an actor over here his name is pirate

0:03:53.130,0:03:58.230
ship I think that's a fine name no no

0:03:55.470,0:04:00.750
need to change that name and he got

0:03:58.230,0:04:02.640
plopped onto our stage now to be honest

0:04:00.750,0:04:06.000
he came onto our stage quite big if you

0:04:02.640,0:04:08.070
remember mine compared to my stage the

0:04:06.000,0:04:09.480
pirate ship was actually very small that

0:04:08.070,0:04:12.300
way I could kind of like make an

0:04:09.480,0:04:13.680
intricate you know island may use for

0:04:12.300,0:04:15.840
him to get through so I'm gonna take my

0:04:13.680,0:04:19.530
pirate ship and I'm gonna make him quite

0:04:15.840,0:04:20.790
a bit smaller and then I'm gonna go

0:04:19.530,0:04:23.239
ahead and just kind of move him up to a

0:04:20.790,0:04:23.239
corner

0:04:24.320,0:04:30.539
so games like this you could really do

0:04:27.210,0:04:33.240
in about any order you could write code

0:04:30.539,0:04:35.639
for the pirate-ship first you could draw

0:04:33.240,0:04:36.780
your background first it really doesn't

0:04:35.639,0:04:38.039
matter I think what I'm going to do is

0:04:36.780,0:04:39.600
I'm going to write just a little bit of

0:04:38.039,0:04:41.880
code because I've already kind of

0:04:39.600,0:04:43.949
started my pirate ship and then after

0:04:41.880,0:04:45.090
that I'm gonna go do some drawing and

0:04:43.949,0:04:47.100
drawing it's going to be kind of the

0:04:45.090,0:04:49.860
interesting things that really bring

0:04:47.100,0:04:51.389
this together so what I'm going to do is

0:04:49.860,0:04:53.130
I'm going to click on my pirate ship

0:04:51.389,0:04:54.479
here you can see that I'm adding code

0:04:53.130,0:04:56.400
for the pirate ship because I've got his

0:04:54.479,0:04:58.860
little icon and I'm just gonna go and

0:04:56.400,0:05:02.220
write a little code for him typically in

0:04:58.860,0:05:04.650
games you have an on start and so on

0:05:02.220,0:05:07.500
start is code that runs whenever you

0:05:04.650,0:05:09.120
want to restart this game and what I'm

0:05:07.500,0:05:11.910
gonna choose to do here is I'm gonna be

0:05:09.120,0:05:14.610
a little like controlling I'm gonna add

0:05:11.910,0:05:17.750
a go to block just to make sure my

0:05:14.610,0:05:20.669
pirates dip starts in the correct spot

0:05:17.750,0:05:22.259
now this go to block isn't strictly

0:05:20.669,0:05:24.750
necessary because obviously he's gonna

0:05:22.259,0:05:26.669
start somewhere and I don't need it but

0:05:24.750,0:05:28.919
I want to make sure he starts in the

0:05:26.669,0:05:30.060
upper left corner here for me if you

0:05:28.919,0:05:33.120
want to use a different corner that's

0:05:30.060,0:05:35.760
that's totally fine now I will say that

0:05:33.120,0:05:38.220
right now my pirate ship if I kind of

0:05:35.760,0:05:40.289
hover my mouse over him he's sitting at

0:05:38.220,0:05:41.520
a certain location so I've got to kind

0:05:40.289,0:05:43.139
of keep my mouse there so you can see it

0:05:41.520,0:05:46.830
but see those numbers that are down here

0:05:43.139,0:05:52.889
my pirate ship right now is at the

0:05:46.830,0:05:55.650
location x equals negative 641 y equals

0:05:52.889,0:05:57.599
305 so what I'm going to do is I'm going

0:05:55.650,0:05:58.830
to get a sheet of paper so pause the

0:05:57.599,0:06:01.080
video and go get a sheet of paper it's

0:05:58.830,0:06:03.720
nice to have a sheet of paper so you can

0:06:01.080,0:06:05.550
write down some numbers right I so I'm

0:06:03.720,0:06:07.229
gonna get a sheet of paper and I'm gonna

0:06:05.550,0:06:12.560
write those numbers down on the sheet of

0:06:07.229,0:06:15.539
paper so for me it's negative 641 Y 305

0:06:12.560,0:06:17.639
so now I've got that written down so now

0:06:15.539,0:06:20.130
if I move my cursor and they go away it

0:06:17.639,0:06:25.139
doesn't matter and I want to put them

0:06:20.130,0:06:26.460
into my code so I typed negative 614 and

0:06:25.139,0:06:32.580
then you can actually hit tab if you

0:06:26.460,0:06:36.210
want 305 and so whatever numbers you

0:06:32.580,0:06:37.110
found so you put your cursor up on the

0:06:36.210,0:06:38.520
ship and you found

0:06:37.110,0:06:40.680
numbers if I do it again they're

0:06:38.520,0:06:41.970
slightly different right you wrote them

0:06:40.680,0:06:43.170
on your sheet of paper we're gonna be

0:06:41.970,0:06:46.200
using the sheet of paper quite a bit

0:06:43.170,0:06:48.000
today and then you moved your mouse and

0:06:46.200,0:06:50.340
you type them in and the reason we wrote

0:06:48.000,0:06:52.170
them down is because we have to move our

0:06:50.340,0:06:53.100
mouse to go type of mam and then we

0:06:52.170,0:06:55.320
can't see them anymore

0:06:53.100,0:06:56.640
if you want to just memorize two numbers

0:06:55.320,0:07:00.090
I'm sure you could but a sheet of paper

0:06:56.640,0:07:01.950
is gonna be handy a lot today so now

0:07:00.090,0:07:03.810
even if our pirate ship was somewhere

0:07:01.950,0:07:06.210
different if I start the game he's gonna

0:07:03.810,0:07:08.760
go to that spot so it's a guaranteed way

0:07:06.210,0:07:10.050
that he'll start in that spot I'm gonna

0:07:08.760,0:07:13.290
just kind of move him up in that area

0:07:10.050,0:07:15.720
anyway the next thing I want to do is I

0:07:13.290,0:07:18.270
want my pirate ship to run code forever

0:07:15.720,0:07:20.760
and ever where he follows the mouse now

0:07:18.270,0:07:23.580
if you have a really good memory you

0:07:20.760,0:07:25.710
might be able to do this based on what

0:07:23.580,0:07:27.900
we did last time but of course I'm gonna

0:07:25.710,0:07:30.050
do it with you so the first thing I want

0:07:27.900,0:07:32.430
to do is I want to drag out a forever

0:07:30.050,0:07:34.410
chunk I went through this a little

0:07:32.430,0:07:37.290
faster I didn't say but it's in the

0:07:34.410,0:07:39.960
control area and then the forever trunk

0:07:37.290,0:07:41.700
the goal of these apps is that as you do

0:07:39.960,0:07:42.960
more and more you start to get more and

0:07:41.700,0:07:44.700
more comfortable and you can actually

0:07:42.960,0:07:46.260
like start to do some things you know

0:07:44.700,0:07:49.080
more on your own as you get better and

0:07:46.260,0:07:52.800
then I want him to point towards the

0:07:49.080,0:07:55.470
mouse pointer and then go ten steps so

0:07:52.800,0:07:59.250
point towards is a type of motion so I'm

0:07:55.470,0:08:01.020
going to go into the motion area and

0:07:59.250,0:08:04.290
then in the motion area I'm gonna look

0:08:01.020,0:08:06.450
for point towards mouse pointer now the

0:08:04.290,0:08:09.270
one people always grab is this one go to

0:08:06.450,0:08:11.490
mouse pointer that is not point towards

0:08:09.270,0:08:13.260
mouse pointer so I'm gonna just kind of

0:08:11.490,0:08:16.620
put that on there just so you can see it

0:08:13.260,0:08:18.630
but the command I want is point towards

0:08:16.620,0:08:20.190
mouse pointer and the difference is

0:08:18.630,0:08:22.110
point towards doesn't move him he just

0:08:20.190,0:08:23.970
he just kind of aims it back right that

0:08:22.110,0:08:26.100
way he'll take some number of steps

0:08:23.970,0:08:26.970
based on the speed and not just warp

0:08:26.100,0:08:29.040
there instantly

0:08:26.970,0:08:31.260
so go-to is bad I'm gonna get rid of

0:08:29.040,0:08:35.610
that the next thing I want to do is I

0:08:31.260,0:08:37.940
want to move ten steps so move ten steps

0:08:35.610,0:08:42.380
is the very first of the move commands

0:08:37.940,0:08:42.380
and I'm gonna say move ten pixels

0:08:43.039,0:08:48.740
and one thing that you do whenever

0:08:46.040,0:08:50.839
you're coding is you stop and you try it

0:08:48.740,0:08:53.329
right so we have we have plenty of code

0:08:50.839,0:08:58.820
here to try it so let's go ahead and run

0:08:53.329,0:09:01.190
our code and we'll see if he follows her

0:08:58.820,0:09:04.730
mouse ah this was a good test because I

0:09:01.190,0:09:07.040
forgot something important so as I move

0:09:04.730,0:09:09.980
it he basically just stays with my mouse

0:09:07.040,0:09:12.500
no matter what I have a bug in my code I

0:09:09.980,0:09:14.389
didn't do it on purpose it just just I

0:09:12.500,0:09:17.720
forgot to have something right and the

0:09:14.389,0:09:20.360
thing I forgot to add is speed is a

0:09:17.720,0:09:22.310
function of how far you move and how

0:09:20.360,0:09:25.730
long you take to do it and right now

0:09:22.310,0:09:28.880
he's moving 10 pixels but there's no

0:09:25.730,0:09:31.370
time delay right so his speed is

0:09:28.880,0:09:33.110
infinitely fast so I needed a time delay

0:09:31.370,0:09:34.730
I just forgot I've been using scratch

0:09:33.110,0:09:38.209
too much Oh scratch you don't need it

0:09:34.730,0:09:45.139
so I need a small time delay so go to

0:09:38.209,0:09:46.730
control inside control add a weight so

0:09:45.139,0:09:49.519
you have to like scroll down until you

0:09:46.730,0:09:51.470
find it it was actually really near the

0:09:49.519,0:09:56.290
bottom so if you go all the way to the

0:09:51.470,0:09:56.290
bottom you'll find this wait one second

0:09:56.470,0:10:02.510
and you can drop it in to the bottom of

0:09:58.970,0:10:05.540
your code now one second is too slow

0:10:02.510,0:10:07.519
right if I if I run this now he's gonna

0:10:05.540,0:10:09.709
just be crawling right so every one

0:10:07.519,0:10:10.970
second it moves ten pixels I don't know

0:10:09.709,0:10:15.160
about you but I think that's way too

0:10:10.970,0:10:22.550
slow so let's make the time be smaller a

0:10:15.160,0:10:25.579
number that I use a lot is 0.05 that's

0:10:22.550,0:10:26.990
five hundredths of a second and so

0:10:25.579,0:10:29.449
basically that makes your game be it

0:10:26.990,0:10:31.459
what's called twenty frames per second

0:10:29.449,0:10:33.350
I'm not worried about the frames per

0:10:31.459,0:10:36.709
second math but he's going to move ten

0:10:33.350,0:10:39.649
pixels every five hundredth of a second

0:10:36.709,0:10:43.220
and now this is a more reasonable speed

0:10:39.649,0:10:45.230
right so now he's moving and everything

0:10:43.220,0:10:47.779
is going fine if he gets to the mouse

0:10:45.230,0:10:49.310
pointer he does kind of freak out there

0:10:47.779,0:10:50.540
are ways that we could fix that but I'm

0:10:49.310,0:10:53.480
not worried about I'm gonna call that a

0:10:50.540,0:10:54.740
feature and the next thing I want to do

0:10:53.480,0:10:56.959
is I want to reinforce

0:10:54.740,0:11:00.470
we've done with variables so instead of

0:10:56.959,0:11:03.200
moving ten pixels I want to make a

0:11:00.470,0:11:06.860
variable so the variable that we're

0:11:03.200,0:11:09.490
going to make is called speed so to make

0:11:06.860,0:11:11.300
a variable we've done this before but

0:11:09.490,0:11:16.459
obviously we need to practice things

0:11:11.300,0:11:19.040
it's in the variables area inside the

0:11:16.459,0:11:20.720
variables area near the top I was kind

0:11:19.040,0:11:26.300
of scrolled down there I want to create

0:11:20.720,0:11:29.209
a variable now whenever you create a

0:11:26.300,0:11:30.830
variable it's that orange button that I

0:11:29.209,0:11:32.029
clicked on whenever you create a

0:11:30.830,0:11:35.089
variable and I ask you a couple

0:11:32.029,0:11:36.740
questions the questions that I ask you

0:11:35.089,0:11:39.050
is to ask you what do you want to name

0:11:36.740,0:11:42.110
your variable this variable is going to

0:11:39.050,0:11:44.720
be for the speed and then there's this

0:11:42.110,0:11:48.200
question of do I want it for all actors

0:11:44.720,0:11:51.290
or do I want to for just this actor last

0:11:48.200,0:11:53.180
time if you remember we said all actors

0:11:51.290,0:11:55.640
and that was because it controlled the

0:11:53.180,0:11:57.709
speed of the monster I guess it was food

0:11:55.640,0:12:00.500
then but the cupcakes changed it so both

0:11:57.709,0:12:03.050
people used it now it's just gonna be

0:12:00.500,0:12:06.230
the shit so you can actually just say

0:12:03.050,0:12:08.120
for this actor only which was the

0:12:06.230,0:12:11.899
default for me so now I go ahead and

0:12:08.120,0:12:14.930
click on create now at this point I have

0:12:11.899,0:12:18.170
a variable it sits in my computer it's

0:12:14.930,0:12:20.600
there but I can't see the value all I

0:12:18.170,0:12:24.440
like to do is I'm gonna add a text

0:12:20.600,0:12:26.839
watcher if you remember how to add a

0:12:24.440,0:12:29.930
text watcher you click on the variable

0:12:26.839,0:12:31.190
over here I think the text Watchers are

0:12:29.930,0:12:32.660
kind of sneaky because it doesn't show

0:12:31.190,0:12:34.130
you the button until you click on it

0:12:32.660,0:12:35.839
right so it's kind of like hidden until

0:12:34.130,0:12:40.579
you click on it and then we click on add

0:12:35.839,0:12:45.230
watcher so that adds a small watcher

0:12:40.579,0:12:46.880
onto my screen now if you remember last

0:12:45.230,0:12:48.890
time there was a bug that we had to

0:12:46.880,0:12:51.529
change in the code that's because it was

0:12:48.890,0:12:54.740
a global that bug won't exists this time

0:12:51.529,0:12:56.630
so we can actually just hit play and we

0:12:54.740,0:12:59.600
should see the value of speed which I

0:12:56.630,0:13:01.520
forgot to set again all right every time

0:12:59.600,0:13:05.510
I seem to forget this at the set the

0:13:01.520,0:13:06.920
speed so last time just to share we had

0:13:05.510,0:13:07.690
to like change something in here I don't

0:13:06.920,0:13:09.640
think that's an

0:13:07.690,0:13:13.360
sorry this time but we do still need to

0:13:09.640,0:13:15.970
set the speed making lots of good errors

0:13:13.360,0:13:19.920
today that's just how it goes so I'm

0:13:15.970,0:13:24.280
going to as the first thing in my code

0:13:19.920,0:13:26.890
I'm going to grab this set and I'm going

0:13:24.280,0:13:28.150
to drop it right after on start I did

0:13:26.890,0:13:29.020
that kind of fast I'm just going to kind

0:13:28.150,0:13:33.250
of show it one more time

0:13:29.020,0:13:35.830
so inside variables I do set and I drop

0:13:33.250,0:13:37.720
it into my code right there that is one

0:13:35.830,0:13:39.840
nice thing about block languages you can

0:13:37.720,0:13:41.890
always just look at my finished product

0:13:39.840,0:13:43.330
and right now it doesn't know what

0:13:41.890,0:13:48.570
variable to set so I'm going to click on

0:13:43.330,0:13:50.680
the drop down and say speed we have

0:13:48.570,0:13:53.260
alright that's the hold on got got a

0:13:50.680,0:13:54.730
question so I'm gonna pause here I've

0:13:53.260,0:13:57.100
got my campers with me again today I

0:13:54.730,0:13:57.610
didn't even say that all right so what's

0:13:57.100,0:14:03.850
your question

0:13:57.610,0:14:08.020
oh yeah so I've got got code like this

0:14:03.850,0:14:09.940
so the problem is and you did a great

0:14:08.020,0:14:11.410
job of following along is that I did

0:14:09.940,0:14:14.650
something quickly that I didn't mention

0:14:11.410,0:14:16.930
to you right now you're changing the

0:14:14.650,0:14:20.140
code for the speed watcher but I'm

0:14:16.930,0:14:22.480
changing the code for my hero so this is

0:14:20.140,0:14:24.310
currently in the wrong spot so Boeing

0:14:22.480,0:14:27.310
you're gonna have to take take something

0:14:24.310,0:14:30.450
out so to take something out click on

0:14:27.310,0:14:36.130
the little handle on the far right and

0:14:30.450,0:14:41.890
trash that and now switch over to the

0:14:36.130,0:14:47.500
sleepy dragon and now grab a set for the

0:14:41.890,0:14:51.220
sleepy dragon and put it up here now bow

0:14:47.500,0:14:53.070
in your code and my code I look to be a

0:14:51.220,0:14:58.589
lot better so that makes sense bone

0:14:53.070,0:15:00.460
great job you can do good alright

0:14:58.589,0:15:03.880
alright so let's keep going

0:15:00.460,0:15:07.300
so speed my goal with speed is that I'm

0:15:03.880,0:15:09.610
gonna start speed at a low number you

0:15:07.300,0:15:12.010
could start it at 10 or you could start

0:15:09.610,0:15:13.980
it at 15 somewhere in that ballpark just

0:15:12.010,0:15:16.330
depending on what you feel is best and

0:15:13.980,0:15:19.330
then what we're gonna do oh I'm gonna do

0:15:16.330,0:15:20.560
my little test first so I set it to 10

0:15:19.330,0:15:20.860
and what I want to do is I want to see

0:15:20.560,0:15:22.600
if

0:15:20.860,0:15:24.250
texe watchers working so I'm just gonna

0:15:22.600,0:15:26.560
run it really quick just to see if my

0:15:24.250,0:15:29.830
text lectures working and it is workin

0:15:26.560,0:15:31.450
right so there was no no bug today so

0:15:29.830,0:15:34.870
what should happen is you should see

0:15:31.450,0:15:36.190
your variable up on your stage by the

0:15:34.870,0:15:37.900
way if you ever want your stage to be

0:15:36.190,0:15:39.940
bigger you can just click on this little

0:15:37.900,0:15:43.720
tab at the top and you can just see the

0:15:39.940,0:15:46.300
stage very quickly there now we've made

0:15:43.720,0:15:48.910
a variable we can see the value of the

0:15:46.300,0:15:51.490
variable but we're not using it anywhere

0:15:48.910,0:15:53.110
and we're not changing it anywhere we're

0:15:51.490,0:15:55.390
gonna change it later well let's go

0:15:53.110,0:15:57.880
ahead and use it for now so take speed

0:15:55.390,0:16:05.200
so this is your speed variable drag

0:15:57.880,0:16:07.300
speed into move speed pixels and so now

0:16:05.200,0:16:10.000
what's gonna happen is your ship is

0:16:07.300,0:16:11.860
going to move based on that variable I

0:16:10.000,0:16:15.280
so just to kind of test it let's say you

0:16:11.860,0:16:17.620
put your speed at 50 so the speed of 50

0:16:15.280,0:16:19.830
should be quite a bit faster and you hit

0:16:17.620,0:16:24.310
play then you're kind of zipping around

0:16:19.830,0:16:26.110
with the speed of 50 and of course if

0:16:24.310,0:16:29.800
your speed was slower let's say I tried

0:16:26.110,0:16:31.510
to that would make my ship move quite a

0:16:29.800,0:16:34.270
bit slower so you can see that this

0:16:31.510,0:16:37.750
variable is being used but right now

0:16:34.270,0:16:39.970
it's not changing and then when you're

0:16:37.750,0:16:43.600
done with that test put it back to it in

0:16:39.970,0:16:46.240
between value now if you did that great

0:16:43.600,0:16:48.400
it's fun like CJ code changes but you

0:16:46.240,0:16:51.040
could also just watch mine and Bend just

0:16:48.400,0:16:53.290
fine so I think our ship is actually

0:16:51.040,0:16:55.720
doing pretty well I think the biggest

0:16:53.290,0:16:58.570
problem that we have now is that our

0:16:55.720,0:17:02.830
ship is sailing in complete whiteness

0:16:58.570,0:17:05.800
right it's not a very good island so I'm

0:17:02.830,0:17:08.020
gonna go ahead and save it so to save it

0:17:05.800,0:17:13.030
right here it says untitled at the top

0:17:08.020,0:17:17.370
I'm gonna save it as Treasure Island you

0:17:13.030,0:17:19.570
can save it as anything you want after I

0:17:17.370,0:17:23.230
do that I'm going to click on the Save

0:17:19.570,0:17:25.270
button you certainly don't need to add a

0:17:23.230,0:17:26.650
description and you will publish it

0:17:25.270,0:17:31.350
later but for now I'm just going to

0:17:26.650,0:17:34.240
click Save right so this is the week 1

0:17:31.350,0:17:39.679
day 2

0:17:34.240,0:17:40.850
demo and adults feel free to do some of

0:17:39.679,0:17:42.530
the typing with them unless you want

0:17:40.850,0:17:45.890
that to be a skill that people are

0:17:42.530,0:17:48.880
learning alright so I'm ready to add a

0:17:45.890,0:17:51.650
stage now last time when we added a

0:17:48.880,0:17:53.419
backdrop for the stage we just used an

0:17:51.650,0:17:56.090
image so I put in a kitchen and it was

0:17:53.419,0:17:57.380
just like boom there this time if you

0:17:56.090,0:17:59.450
kind of like Lance up my finished

0:17:57.380,0:18:01.730
product this time what's going to happen

0:17:59.450,0:18:04.070
is we're going to draw so we're gonna

0:18:01.730,0:18:06.230
have to fill in the water with a blue

0:18:04.070,0:18:08.750
color and we're gonna have to draw

0:18:06.230,0:18:11.960
different islands now one thing to think

0:18:08.750,0:18:14.299
about as you draw your islands is think

0:18:11.960,0:18:16.429
about the size of your ship now you have

0:18:14.299,0:18:19.549
to make a game to where your ship can

0:18:16.429,0:18:21.679
get through your obstacles where it's

0:18:19.549,0:18:23.809
possible but it's also you know

0:18:21.679,0:18:25.580
potentially kind of fun and challenging

0:18:23.809,0:18:27.470
right so don't make it too easy

0:18:25.580,0:18:30.169
and don't make it too hard and this is

0:18:27.470,0:18:31.970
where the creativity aspect comes in I

0:18:30.169,0:18:33.230
also like to add little challenges of

0:18:31.970,0:18:34.370
mine like where somebody like things

0:18:33.230,0:18:36.080
they might be able to shoot it through

0:18:34.370,0:18:37.429
the middle I can't believe I just did

0:18:36.080,0:18:41.360
that I maybe I make it through the

0:18:37.429,0:18:43.789
middle like 1 in 10 times right and then

0:18:41.360,0:18:46.159
you know it's it's a fun challenging

0:18:43.789,0:18:49.030
game so that's kind of the idea so let's

0:18:46.159,0:18:51.890
go start brawling so click on the stage

0:18:49.030,0:18:54.380
you'll notice that the stage has no code

0:18:51.890,0:18:55.880
and there's no backdrop yet so the only

0:18:54.380,0:18:58.780
thing if you click on the stage is this

0:18:55.880,0:19:01.580
gear so go and click on this little gear

0:18:58.780,0:19:03.799
and what we want to do is and it says

0:19:01.580,0:19:06.710
hey the stage can't up costume sounds

0:19:03.799,0:19:08.990
and advanced things we want costumes and

0:19:06.710,0:19:12.470
so we want to click on add background so

0:19:08.990,0:19:14.240
go and click on add backgrounds ok now

0:19:12.470,0:19:15.590
this screen we saw last time this is

0:19:14.240,0:19:17.780
actually trying to encourage you to

0:19:15.590,0:19:19.750
select a different background but we

0:19:17.780,0:19:22.190
want to do this time is we want to draw

0:19:19.750,0:19:25.190
so up here at the top there's a little

0:19:22.190,0:19:26.600
paintbrush and so this is where we're

0:19:25.190,0:19:29.720
gonna draw image so go and click on

0:19:26.600,0:19:31.640
drawl image and for some reason you have

0:19:29.720,0:19:36.020
to click it again tip to come draw image

0:19:31.640,0:19:37.909
again maybe if we came back in here I

0:19:36.020,0:19:42.350
would see something different so now we

0:19:37.909,0:19:44.390
are to the heart of today so this is the

0:19:42.350,0:19:45.770
drawing interface so the first thing

0:19:44.390,0:19:47.120
we're going to do is we're going to draw

0:19:45.770,0:19:49.100
some together

0:19:47.120,0:19:51.920
to learn and then we're going to delete

0:19:49.100,0:19:53.210
it and then we'll come back for the real

0:19:51.920,0:19:55.250
thing so this we're just we're just kind

0:19:53.210,0:19:58.370
of learning so let's kind of learn more

0:19:55.250,0:20:00.530
about what this setup is so there's

0:19:58.370,0:20:02.270
different like drawing tools over all

0:20:00.530,0:20:05.000
the left and then there's different

0:20:02.270,0:20:07.010
colors on the bottom so for this example

0:20:05.000,0:20:08.840
I don't care what color you pick but

0:20:07.010,0:20:10.640
pick some fun color that you'd like to

0:20:08.840,0:20:11.810
just kind of test with does not have to

0:20:10.640,0:20:14.480
be related to the ship we're going to

0:20:11.810,0:20:15.770
delete this here in a little bit and

0:20:14.480,0:20:19.670
what we're going to do is we're gonna

0:20:15.770,0:20:21.920
select the pencil so the pencil is one

0:20:19.670,0:20:24.470
of your main drawing tools with the

0:20:21.920,0:20:27.950
pencil you can change how big it is

0:20:24.470,0:20:30.710
right so go ahead and with the pencil I

0:20:27.950,0:20:32.750
just kind of draw a little bit and you

0:20:30.710,0:20:35.600
can kind of see how drawing with the

0:20:32.750,0:20:37.880
pencil works now if somebody is is a

0:20:35.600,0:20:39.950
great artist maybe they could draw you

0:20:37.880,0:20:43.250
know something fun I'm a lousy artist

0:20:39.950,0:20:47.440
right so my art with a pencil would be

0:20:43.250,0:20:50.510
not very good but I do really like that

0:20:47.440,0:20:53.900
tinker and scratch both really encourage

0:20:50.510,0:20:56.060
and allow creativity and drawing there

0:20:53.900,0:20:57.920
was a recent post on tinker where she

0:20:56.060,0:21:00.890
draws a dog and like she's just amazing

0:20:57.920,0:21:02.840
so look up virtual pet some time on

0:21:00.890,0:21:04.450
thinker and you'll see how good she is

0:21:02.840,0:21:07.190
at drawing things right

0:21:04.450,0:21:09.940
other skills that we want to learn so

0:21:07.190,0:21:12.860
that's the pencil there's also the brush

0:21:09.940,0:21:15.050
the brush is for adding like artistic

0:21:12.860,0:21:16.490
effects so you notice that the brush is

0:21:15.050,0:21:19.180
similar to the pencil and that you can

0:21:16.490,0:21:21.980
change size but the brush has this like

0:21:19.180,0:21:24.200
opacity meter so this is where you can

0:21:21.980,0:21:26.000
add like you know really elaborate

0:21:24.200,0:21:27.890
shadings to your drawing and things like

0:21:26.000,0:21:30.740
that so we don't need the brush today

0:21:27.890,0:21:33.860
but I wanted to point out the brush the

0:21:30.740,0:21:37.240
eraser tool is fairly self-explanatory

0:21:33.860,0:21:41.180
it erases right so you can erase things

0:21:37.240,0:21:43.400
the fill the Paint Bucket this one's

0:21:41.180,0:21:47.420
interesting this one will let you fill

0:21:43.400,0:21:50.510
in any closed shape so let's say that I

0:21:47.420,0:21:53.720
clicked on my Paint Bucket I clicked on

0:21:50.510,0:21:55.850
this yellow and then I click inside my

0:21:53.720,0:21:58.220
circle and you'll notice that it fills

0:21:55.850,0:21:59.580
it all in now the thing you have to be

0:21:58.220,0:22:01.620
careful about with fill

0:21:59.580,0:22:03.990
is that it does have to be like a closed

0:22:01.620,0:22:06.090
shape so for example let's say that I

0:22:03.990,0:22:07.560
put my mouse right here and I click

0:22:06.090,0:22:09.660
right here

0:22:07.560,0:22:15.180
but what anything's going to happen if I

0:22:09.660,0:22:16.620
click right here with yellow yeah it's

0:22:15.180,0:22:18.210
just gonna do the whole entire screen so

0:22:16.620,0:22:19.980
if I click there it just does the whole

0:22:18.210,0:22:22.650
entire screen yellow and that's because

0:22:19.980,0:22:23.880
phil has to be a closed shape and you'll

0:22:22.650,0:22:26.190
notice that this one is it's very much

0:22:23.880,0:22:28.170
open so when we're drawing Islands today

0:22:26.190,0:22:30.270
I just kind of wanted to to reinforce

0:22:28.170,0:22:32.520
this if you draw an island like this

0:22:30.270,0:22:35.070
it's gonna work perfectly if you draw an

0:22:32.520,0:22:37.440
island like that it's gonna work very

0:22:35.070,0:22:39.810
badly right so if I fill that one in

0:22:37.440,0:22:41.730
oops I need to go to my my fill I fill

0:22:39.810,0:22:44.340
this one then it works great if I fill

0:22:41.730,0:22:46.350
this Island in it works very badly so

0:22:44.340,0:22:49.950
just kind of be aware that that's how

0:22:46.350,0:22:51.810
the fill tool works the stamp tool is

0:22:49.950,0:22:54.450
fun it's just for adding a little like

0:22:51.810,0:22:57.600
decorations to your to your thing

0:22:54.450,0:23:00.990
usually when you stamp something it's

0:22:57.600,0:23:04.170
not for functionality it's just for fun

0:23:00.990,0:23:07.710
right and so if you ever want to

0:23:04.170,0:23:11.040
decorate your your art you can do some

0:23:07.710,0:23:13.890
stamps you can go crazy with these

0:23:11.040,0:23:15.330
things right these other tools we're not

0:23:13.890,0:23:16.710
going to use as much today but I thought

0:23:15.330,0:23:19.740
I'd point them out so there's a line

0:23:16.710,0:23:22.710
tool do notice the line also has this

0:23:19.740,0:23:25.310
thing called opacity so I'm just going

0:23:22.710,0:23:27.450
to kind of ensure that there's squares

0:23:25.310,0:23:30.540
there's there's all kinds of things you

0:23:27.450,0:23:33.090
can do right the other thing is text

0:23:30.540,0:23:35.790
text is fun because you can decide what

0:23:33.090,0:23:38.850
font you want to use so if I wanted to

0:23:35.790,0:23:43.380
say David Fisher I can do it in a cool

0:23:38.850,0:23:45.540
flat now I'm gonna point out something

0:23:43.380,0:23:47.130
tricky cuz you guys are good let's let's

0:23:45.540,0:23:48.540
say what's what's tricky about the

0:23:47.130,0:23:51.180
drawing tool well one thing that's

0:23:48.540,0:23:53.280
tricky is I just typed this and if I

0:23:51.180,0:23:55.830
just typed it and I drag it I can move

0:23:53.280,0:23:57.780
it to say right there now as soon as I

0:23:55.830,0:23:59.580
click off on it

0:23:57.780,0:24:01.830
what's happened is I've clicked off on

0:23:59.580,0:24:03.810
it and it's it's it's called a blip

0:24:01.830,0:24:06.330
that's what it is and it's it's been

0:24:03.810,0:24:08.220
painted on to the background I can no

0:24:06.330,0:24:11.870
longer just grab it at this point right

0:24:08.220,0:24:13.760
so that's how tinker works

0:24:11.870,0:24:16.820
if I just kind of do another example

0:24:13.760,0:24:19.850
here so this is a test whenever I make

0:24:16.820,0:24:22.640
it I can kind of move it around but as

0:24:19.850,0:24:24.800
soon as I let go of it it's done

0:24:22.640,0:24:27.230
it sits on there right so it got pasted

0:24:24.800,0:24:30.980
in and that same thing is true for four

0:24:27.230,0:24:34.040
rectangles and you know I could I can

0:24:30.980,0:24:35.900
grab it I can actually resize it but as

0:24:34.040,0:24:36.800
soon as I let go of it as soon as I

0:24:35.900,0:24:39.560
click somewhere else

0:24:36.800,0:24:41.180
it's pasted onto the screen it's called

0:24:39.560,0:24:43.280
bitmap mode if you're used to scratch

0:24:41.180,0:24:45.350
and you've used its vector mode this

0:24:43.280,0:24:47.330
does behave differently now what's

0:24:45.350,0:24:49.610
worrying about one other thing I've been

0:24:47.330,0:24:53.540
making this game I've been making this

0:24:49.610,0:24:55.850
backdrop and I happen to know that what

0:24:53.540,0:24:58.130
I'm looking at on the screen is actually

0:24:55.850,0:24:59.960
not the whole stage and the reason I

0:24:58.130,0:25:01.340
know that it's because see these bars on

0:24:59.960,0:25:05.690
the side saying they don't fill the

0:25:01.340,0:25:09.920
whole thing zoom out for me so it turns

0:25:05.690,0:25:11.780
out that my stage was actually bigger

0:25:09.920,0:25:13.160
than what I was looking at right and

0:25:11.780,0:25:15.920
that's just something you have to be

0:25:13.160,0:25:18.020
careful of so you have to be careful if

0:25:15.920,0:25:20.780
you're drawing so like I've done this

0:25:18.020,0:25:22.640
mistake a couple times but I start

0:25:20.780,0:25:25.820
drawing and like I fill up the whole

0:25:22.640,0:25:28.820
thing and then I realized later that I

0:25:25.820,0:25:31.070
was actually waves good cool so that is

0:25:28.820,0:25:34.490
a beautiful backdrop I'm pretty proud of

0:25:31.070,0:25:37.850
it but I want to start fresh all right

0:25:34.490,0:25:39.830
so that is your opportunity to go nuts

0:25:37.850,0:25:42.080
if you need another second draw draw

0:25:39.830,0:25:44.420
like crazy but now what we're gonna do

0:25:42.080,0:25:47.840
is we're gonna work together to build

0:25:44.420,0:25:49.820
something specific so your dots on this

0:25:47.840,0:25:52.280
sheet as much as you want but on the

0:25:49.820,0:25:56.060
next one let's try to actually achieve a

0:25:52.280,0:25:59.980
mission right so I clicked on add a

0:25:56.060,0:26:02.510
costume it gives me a nice blank slate

0:25:59.980,0:26:05.900
just because I feel like it it's called

0:26:02.510,0:26:10.190
blank one but I'm gonna change the name

0:26:05.900,0:26:12.650
to be islands that is not necessary I

0:26:10.190,0:26:14.000
just just don't like doing it the next

0:26:12.650,0:26:16.820
thing I want to do is I want to change

0:26:14.000,0:26:19.040
my zoom level to try to like make sure

0:26:16.820,0:26:21.440
I'm seeing everything right so if I

0:26:19.040,0:26:25.670
change my zoom level to where I'm seeing

0:26:21.440,0:26:26.960
everything I feel like seeing everything

0:26:25.670,0:26:29.360
so now we're trying to do something

0:26:26.960,0:26:32.120
specific so we're trying to make an

0:26:29.360,0:26:36.140
ocean so pick your favorite color of

0:26:32.120,0:26:37.730
blue so my favorite color of blue is I

0:26:36.140,0:26:40.640
could pick just this one down here at

0:26:37.730,0:26:43.340
the bottom if you don't like that shade

0:26:40.640,0:26:44.450
of blue there's this color picker down

0:26:43.340,0:26:47.000
here I don't know if you've seen this

0:26:44.450,0:26:51.020
yet but for this color picker I can pick

0:26:47.000,0:26:53.150
any shade of blue that I would like and

0:26:51.020,0:26:55.910
then once you've got the color you want

0:26:53.150,0:26:58.670
you can hit the X so now you've got the

0:26:55.910,0:27:01.760
world's best shade of blue and then you

0:26:58.670,0:27:04.970
want to go to the paint bucket and you

0:27:01.760,0:27:06.290
want to click anywhere and what that

0:27:04.970,0:27:09.440
should do is actually turn your whole

0:27:06.290,0:27:12.200
world blue right so now you have a blue

0:27:09.440,0:27:14.570
world now what we're going to do is

0:27:12.200,0:27:15.650
we're going to start drawing the outline

0:27:14.570,0:27:17.990
of Islands

0:27:15.650,0:27:19.370
so to draw the outline of Islands we're

0:27:17.990,0:27:25.580
going to use the most common tool the

0:27:19.370,0:27:28.250
pencil tool the size can be either 14 or

0:27:25.580,0:27:29.690
20 something near the top is fine by the

0:27:28.250,0:27:31.010
way you can use this slider and you can

0:27:29.690,0:27:32.540
get other values too I'm just gonna go

0:27:31.010,0:27:36.590
ahead and draw with 20 that'll be fine

0:27:32.540,0:27:39.860
and now I need to pick the color for my

0:27:36.590,0:27:41.630
islands now for the coding reasons your

0:27:39.860,0:27:43.880
islands all have to be the same color

0:27:41.630,0:27:46.370
because what the ship is doing is it

0:27:43.880,0:27:48.800
saying hey if I touch this color that I

0:27:46.370,0:27:51.860
that I'm doing right so let's pick the

0:27:48.800,0:27:53.630
color for your islands I'm gonna go with

0:27:51.860,0:27:55.250
kind of like some type of green color

0:27:53.630,0:27:56.960
but if you want to use a different color

0:27:55.250,0:28:00.650
that's fine let's say you like purple

0:27:56.960,0:28:02.450
Islands that's no big deal right if you

0:28:00.650,0:28:04.760
wanted to you could also like pick a

0:28:02.450,0:28:06.290
very specific color inside the color

0:28:04.760,0:28:07.970
picker that'd be just fine

0:28:06.290,0:28:10.340
I maybe I'll go with kind of like a dark

0:28:07.970,0:28:15.800
green island and what I'm gonna do is

0:28:10.340,0:28:18.980
I'm gonna draw my islands so here's

0:28:15.800,0:28:20.660
where your your creativity comes in I'm

0:28:18.980,0:28:24.890
gonna choose to have kind of like one

0:28:20.660,0:28:27.440
big island and then a couple other small

0:28:24.890,0:28:29.240
more islands so you can see with the way

0:28:27.440,0:28:31.460
I'm gonna strategize my game I'm gonna

0:28:29.240,0:28:34.220
make it to where you could if your risky

0:28:31.460,0:28:36.680
shoot through the short cut but then

0:28:34.220,0:28:39.220
it's easier if you go a lot around the

0:28:36.680,0:28:42.429
long way so

0:28:39.220,0:28:43.840
not gonna you know give you an unlimited

0:28:42.429,0:28:44.980
amount of time to do this you're

0:28:43.840,0:28:48.490
probably gonna have to pause the video

0:28:44.980,0:28:51.700
but you can draw shapes for each of this

0:28:48.490,0:28:55.419
right kids love to draw and if your

0:28:51.700,0:28:57.520
first pass goes weld and super I hope it

0:28:55.419,0:28:59.679
goes badly you know you can always do it

0:28:57.520,0:29:02.409
again so I'm gonna draw all some shapes

0:28:59.679,0:29:05.799
just to kind of like make my game tricky

0:29:02.409,0:29:09.580
and what I'm trying to keep in mind is

0:29:05.799,0:29:14.350
is there some way my ship can like get

0:29:09.580,0:29:15.820
through to the other side and I think

0:29:14.350,0:29:18.640
that I've kind of done that with my

0:29:15.820,0:29:22.690
shapes once you've got a couple shapes

0:29:18.640,0:29:25.480
it's time to fill them in to fill a menu

0:29:22.690,0:29:32.140
go to your paint bucket and you fill in

0:29:25.480,0:29:34.419
your very shapes and you can zoom in to

0:29:32.140,0:29:37.030
try to like hit them better if you want

0:29:34.419,0:29:40.120
or whatever you need now you'll notice

0:29:37.030,0:29:41.590
that for me whenever I make a circle

0:29:40.120,0:29:43.539
like this and then fill it in I get kind

0:29:41.590,0:29:45.880
of like this little outline if that

0:29:43.539,0:29:47.409
outline bugs yeah that's fine you can

0:29:45.880,0:29:51.370
come back through with your pencil and

0:29:47.409,0:29:54.730
you can get rid of that outline right so

0:29:51.370,0:29:55.870
if you are not an OCD person feel free

0:29:54.730,0:29:58.600
just to leave it because it doesn't

0:29:55.870,0:30:02.830
affect anything badly it's just that

0:29:58.600,0:30:05.100
it's there so go ahead and pause the

0:30:02.830,0:30:08.350
video and get your islands just right

0:30:05.100,0:30:09.909
hey my crew was a drawing and they they

0:30:08.350,0:30:11.620
occasionally wanted to like erase

0:30:09.909,0:30:13.450
something and turn it back to blue and a

0:30:11.620,0:30:15.280
skill that they used a lot was this

0:30:13.450,0:30:18.669
eyedropper tool so if they ever needed

0:30:15.280,0:30:20.919
to draw in blue again you say eyedropper

0:30:18.669,0:30:22.630
and blue and then that lets you kind of

0:30:20.919,0:30:24.970
have an opportunity to kind of like draw

0:30:22.630,0:30:26.530
in your blue so like I could dido loop

0:30:24.970,0:30:27.970
this out a little bit more or if they

0:30:26.530,0:30:29.559
wanted to draw more on their island

0:30:27.970,0:30:31.659
color they could use the eyedropper

0:30:29.559,0:30:33.130
click there island color and then they

0:30:31.659,0:30:34.659
could draw a little bit more than color

0:30:33.130,0:30:36.970
so that was a good skill for them and

0:30:34.659,0:30:39.789
the next thing we want to do is we want

0:30:36.970,0:30:42.280
to put another color on here which is

0:30:39.789,0:30:44.590
our victory color and so this is like

0:30:42.280,0:30:48.280
our goal or target that we're trying to

0:30:44.590,0:30:49.960
get to and so let's go ahead and draw

0:30:48.280,0:30:52.519
I'll just go and use the pencil again I

0:30:49.960,0:30:55.879
use a big pencil but pick a new color

0:30:52.519,0:30:58.970
for your career victory so this is kind

0:30:55.879,0:31:01.009
of like your your gold right and so

0:30:58.970,0:31:05.450
somewhere I just kind of like put a

0:31:01.009,0:31:08.230
little patch that is your goal so if the

0:31:05.450,0:31:10.669
ship gets to here then you're gonna win

0:31:08.230,0:31:12.470
now interestingly I picked a very

0:31:10.669,0:31:14.799
different color I just so you could see

0:31:12.470,0:31:17.600
it quite vividly but it couldn't be

0:31:14.799,0:31:19.909
similar in color just so long as it's

0:31:17.600,0:31:22.669
it's different a little bit right so

0:31:19.909,0:31:26.749
that's my goal now if you would like to

0:31:22.669,0:31:30.200
decorate you can with one caveat you

0:31:26.749,0:31:31.909
cannot use either of those two colors so

0:31:30.200,0:31:34.129
if you start like making stamps and

0:31:31.909,0:31:36.559
things if there are completely different

0:31:34.129,0:31:38.690
colors you can do that I'm not going to

0:31:36.559,0:31:43.490
do a lot of decoration but I would like

0:31:38.690,0:31:45.200
to add some text to my Big Island and

0:31:43.490,0:31:47.840
the text that I'm gonna add is I'm gonna

0:31:45.200,0:31:49.340
add white text so I click on color so

0:31:47.840,0:31:53.360
I'm gonna click on white color here and

0:31:49.340,0:31:55.249
I'm gonna click on text and I'm gonna

0:31:53.360,0:31:58.129
pick the font that I think is best now I

0:31:55.249,0:32:01.820
like Pacifico right so I use Pacifica a

0:31:58.129,0:32:03.799
lot and you can change what size your

0:32:01.820,0:32:08.210
letters are gonna come out I'm gonna I'm

0:32:03.799,0:32:12.559
gonna pick about a 60 or so and now I'm

0:32:08.210,0:32:14.570
going to click somewhere to type now you

0:32:12.559,0:32:16.369
can type anywhere because you can still

0:32:14.570,0:32:18.619
move it after you finish typing but you

0:32:16.369,0:32:19.759
only get to move it like one time and

0:32:18.619,0:32:22.999
then as soon as you let go

0:32:19.759,0:32:25.309
it's it stuck on there just for giggles

0:32:22.999,0:32:29.240
I will make a mistake right so I'm gonna

0:32:25.309,0:32:36.259
click up here I'm gonna say you know

0:32:29.240,0:32:40.159
Dave Fisher's islands and so I want this

0:32:36.259,0:32:42.019
to be moved into here right now if I did

0:32:40.159,0:32:45.019
mess up let's say I put it up here and

0:32:42.019,0:32:46.279
then I let go of it I'd stuck there

0:32:45.019,0:32:48.139
right by the way it jumped a little bit

0:32:46.279,0:32:50.480
another trick that you really should

0:32:48.139,0:32:52.909
know about is the undo button right so

0:32:50.480,0:32:54.710
you click on the undo button and that

0:32:52.909,0:32:57.409
will make your life a lot easier so I

0:32:54.710,0:33:00.919
should have told you about that that

0:32:57.409,0:33:04.639
button a long time ago so if you want to

0:33:00.919,0:33:06.029
add text or something you can so there

0:33:04.639,0:33:09.809
I'm going to add Dave Fisher

0:33:06.029,0:33:13.559
Islands and then once you're happy with

0:33:09.809,0:33:16.859
that we can click on save and we can go

0:33:13.559,0:33:18.389
back to the other one so I've got who

0:33:16.859,0:33:19.710
actually before we go back let's do one

0:33:18.389,0:33:23.729
more thing let's write down some stuff

0:33:19.710,0:33:27.509
onto our sheet of paper so our code

0:33:23.729,0:33:29.429
needs to know what colors were used so

0:33:27.509,0:33:31.109
we're gonna need that in our code so

0:33:29.429,0:33:33.299
what I want to do is I want to know

0:33:31.109,0:33:36.749
exactly what shade of green is that

0:33:33.299,0:33:37.889
exactly what shade of pink is that so

0:33:36.749,0:33:40.499
here's what I'm gonna do to figure that

0:33:37.889,0:33:41.849
out I'm gonna click on the eyedropper so

0:33:40.499,0:33:42.869
follow along with me even if you're

0:33:41.849,0:33:46.049
doing something different click on the

0:33:42.869,0:33:47.820
eyedropper click on you're your death

0:33:46.049,0:33:52.229
color so click on one of your islands

0:33:47.820,0:33:56.249
and then click on this light color

0:33:52.229,0:33:59.639
selector I know it's like 18 steps right

0:33:56.249,0:34:02.429
and then click on hex so the number you

0:33:59.639,0:34:04.349
need the number you need is this hex

0:34:02.429,0:34:09.569
color right here so on your sheet of

0:34:04.349,0:34:10.829
paper write down your hex color don't

0:34:09.569,0:34:13.289
worry you'll see the whole process again

0:34:10.829,0:34:15.809
when I do it for for the next one I also

0:34:13.289,0:34:18.470
hate the font that they used because

0:34:15.809,0:34:20.429
there are some numbers and some letters

0:34:18.470,0:34:22.470
just so you know how it works

0:34:20.429,0:34:25.529
the letters if it's a letter is going to

0:34:22.470,0:34:32.700
be a through F and the numbers are 4 0

0:34:25.529,0:34:34.139
through 9 so mine here is 6 5 8 0 3 B so

0:34:32.700,0:34:35.879
there's an 8 and a B in there I know

0:34:34.139,0:34:37.770
that's super annoying so hold on let's

0:34:35.879,0:34:40.500
go through that process again so you

0:34:37.770,0:34:45.210
click on the eyedropper you click on the

0:34:40.500,0:34:48.690
thing that you want to discover then you

0:34:45.210,0:34:51.720
click on the color chooser and then you

0:34:48.690,0:34:54.510
click on hex by the way scratch makes

0:34:51.720,0:34:56.849
this way easier but let's not think it

0:34:54.510,0:35:00.150
works so now I'm going to write down the

0:34:56.849,0:35:02.069
color of my my victory all that when I

0:35:00.150,0:35:04.950
maybe could have memorized kind of looks

0:35:02.069,0:35:08.160
like the word food except for those O's

0:35:04.950,0:35:09.779
or zeros yeah O's and zeros are never a

0:35:08.160,0:35:11.250
question you know that it's a number you

0:35:09.779,0:35:13.890
know that it's a zero because the

0:35:11.250,0:35:19.289
letters can only be a through F right so

0:35:13.890,0:35:19.530
this one is FF 0 0 D 5 so yeah it's like

0:35:19.289,0:35:22.710
a

0:35:19.530,0:35:26.640
four-step process so you click on color

0:35:22.710,0:35:28.830
chooser I'm sorry I dropper then the

0:35:26.640,0:35:30.990
color chooser and then hax and that's

0:35:28.830,0:35:33.570
the number that your codes going to need

0:35:30.990,0:35:34.740
so I've written down both of mine and

0:35:33.570,0:35:37.650
then I'm gonna put a little annotation

0:35:34.740,0:35:40.530
next to them for which one is green and

0:35:37.650,0:35:42.510
which one is pink for me right by the

0:35:40.530,0:35:44.790
way if you happen to really like know

0:35:42.510,0:35:47.100
about colors and light colors and what a

0:35:44.790,0:35:50.430
lot about hexadecimals this number is

0:35:47.100,0:35:53.550
meaningful but that's not now or up to

0:35:50.430,0:35:55.860
today cool so once you've got your

0:35:53.550,0:35:57.780
colors written down you're done with the

0:35:55.860,0:36:00.210
drawing part of today that's the main

0:35:57.780,0:36:03.450
part of today and you can go back to

0:36:00.210,0:36:06.930
your game now when I click back

0:36:03.450,0:36:08.850
it looks like I've still got the two two

0:36:06.930,0:36:09.840
drawings that are made in here you can

0:36:08.850,0:36:12.060
see I'm kind of switching in the

0:36:09.840,0:36:14.910
backdrop I want the one that's the

0:36:12.060,0:36:17.940
islands right so make sure that you've

0:36:14.910,0:36:19.950
got the island set up now if you're

0:36:17.940,0:36:23.340
having problems like getting your Island

0:36:19.950,0:36:25.320
one set up you could always add code to

0:36:23.340,0:36:28.950
like explicitly set it so you could say

0:36:25.320,0:36:30.240
like switch background - but mine looks

0:36:28.950,0:36:32.340
like it's working fine so I'm not gonna

0:36:30.240,0:36:35.430
add any code alright let's finish this

0:36:32.340,0:36:39.600
game so let's go to our pirate ship so

0:36:35.430,0:36:41.700
right now if you play your game you can

0:36:39.600,0:36:43.380
sail right through your islands it

0:36:41.700,0:36:45.330
doesn't really matter right so that's

0:36:43.380,0:36:46.350
just how this game works how you can say

0:36:45.330,0:36:47.520
all right over here and touch your

0:36:46.350,0:36:49.710
treasure but nothing happens there

0:36:47.520,0:36:52.440
either the reason I'm doing this is

0:36:49.710,0:36:54.120
because this is a way to test I did you

0:36:52.440,0:36:56.520
did you do a good job with your game

0:36:54.120,0:36:58.860
right like can you go through your

0:36:56.520,0:37:00.780
various obstacles to be honest if

0:36:58.860,0:37:02.670
anything mine's almost too easy right so

0:37:00.780,0:37:04.170
I can fit right through there um so you

0:37:02.670,0:37:06.150
can tweak things like that to your

0:37:04.170,0:37:07.890
heart's content but I'm not gonna make

0:37:06.150,0:37:09.420
time to do now I'm gonna call mine good

0:37:07.890,0:37:13.020
enough so that we can all move forward

0:37:09.420,0:37:17.250
right so now let's let's have the pirate

0:37:13.020,0:37:20.490
ship check am i touching the islands and

0:37:17.250,0:37:24.750
if so I lose right or am i touching the

0:37:20.490,0:37:27.060
goal um and if so I win so a check is an

0:37:24.750,0:37:30.900
if statement so an if statement is in

0:37:27.060,0:37:33.340
control and so we're going to add an if

0:37:30.900,0:37:36.640
statement for a my touching

0:37:33.340,0:37:38.260
the island and then because we know that

0:37:36.640,0:37:40.240
this code is coming I'm gonna go ahead

0:37:38.260,0:37:42.910
and add another if statement that's

0:37:40.240,0:37:45.910
gonna be like am i touching victory

0:37:42.910,0:37:47.740
right so it's either have I died or have

0:37:45.910,0:37:49.000
I won and if neither of those things are

0:37:47.740,0:37:52.900
happened then we just keep playing right

0:37:49.000,0:37:56.320
so I drug over the if it says false then

0:37:52.900,0:37:59.830
but if something then do this all right

0:37:56.320,0:38:01.810
so we want to put into these condition

0:37:59.830,0:38:04.750
statements so if this condition then do

0:38:01.810,0:38:07.960
this am i touching a certain color and

0:38:04.750,0:38:09.220
so the one that says touching color and

0:38:07.960,0:38:12.100
sensing is right here it's the fourth

0:38:09.220,0:38:16.300
one down so drop one of these in here

0:38:12.100,0:38:18.580
and then drop one of these in there now

0:38:16.300,0:38:21.310
we've got two colors we've got one color

0:38:18.580,0:38:23.260
which is it's death and the other color

0:38:21.310,0:38:25.540
which is victory what I'm going to do is

0:38:23.260,0:38:29.950
I'm going to type into this top one my

0:38:25.540,0:38:35.080
my death color right so you type in your

0:38:29.950,0:38:38.110
color and I'll type in mine and it's

0:38:35.080,0:38:40.030
going to be some combination of numbers

0:38:38.110,0:38:43.270
and letters now the nice thing is is

0:38:40.030,0:38:44.650
when you finish you should get feedback

0:38:43.270,0:38:47.230
that you did good because it should

0:38:44.650,0:38:49.360
change to be the color that matches the

0:38:47.230,0:38:51.670
stage so I'm going to do that for my

0:38:49.360,0:38:56.670
other one as well make sure you leave

0:38:51.670,0:38:59.500
that little hatch over there right so FF

0:38:56.670,0:39:02.470
so don't worry about my colors you worry

0:38:59.500,0:39:04.630
about your colors right so there I

0:39:02.470,0:39:05.890
should have typed in both of my colors

0:39:04.630,0:39:12.610
that I'm done with my sheet of paper now

0:39:05.890,0:39:13.480
right so now in my code I'm checking did

0:39:12.610,0:39:16.930
I lose

0:39:13.480,0:39:19.810
did I win and then I'm gonna do stuff in

0:39:16.930,0:39:23.350
those two situations so if you touch the

0:39:19.810,0:39:24.700
island then you've just died and so what

0:39:23.350,0:39:27.040
we want to do is we want to say

0:39:24.700,0:39:29.230
something along those lines so I like

0:39:27.040,0:39:30.340
speech bubbles again there's these

0:39:29.230,0:39:32.230
speech bubbles that are really

0:39:30.340,0:39:34.150
intimidating they have lots of features

0:39:32.230,0:39:36.250
then there's a really simple ones I

0:39:34.150,0:39:39.250
would like to use a simple one that

0:39:36.250,0:39:41.410
would be great but I need features right

0:39:39.250,0:39:43.980
so I'm going to pick the very top speech

0:39:41.410,0:39:46.740
bubble so right now it says say hello

0:39:43.980,0:39:49.589
and then for two seconds

0:39:46.740,0:39:51.540
so instead of saying hello this is where

0:39:49.589,0:40:00.690
they've just wrecked their ship right so

0:39:51.540,0:40:05.490
I'm gonna say you rekt yo ship so you

0:40:00.690,0:40:06.990
can say whatever you'd like to say so

0:40:05.490,0:40:09.089
once you get your type you might have to

0:40:06.990,0:40:11.790
pause the video but once you get your

0:40:09.089,0:40:14.430
type you can then pick the style so the

0:40:11.790,0:40:15.690
style by default is a bottom message or

0:40:14.430,0:40:17.880
bottom message like takes over this

0:40:15.690,0:40:20.250
whole bottom bar I think I would rather

0:40:17.880,0:40:23.190
it it felt like the ship was saying it

0:40:20.250,0:40:26.430
and so I'm gonna put it on a rectangular

0:40:23.190,0:40:28.800
like speech bubble but if you like the

0:40:26.430,0:40:30.630
bottom well that's fine but I'm gonna go

0:40:28.800,0:40:32.640
with the rectangular speech bubble and

0:40:30.630,0:40:35.130
in a speech bubble I happen to know the

0:40:32.640,0:40:39.300
18 is really small so I'm gonna bump it

0:40:35.130,0:40:42.930
up to 48 so I'm just gonna say you

0:40:39.300,0:40:44.099
wrecked your ship and then I'll tell

0:40:42.930,0:40:45.270
what I'll go ahead and play it right now

0:40:44.099,0:40:46.920
just so you can see a problem that's

0:40:45.270,0:40:49.260
gonna come up if you wrecked your ship

0:40:46.920,0:40:51.150
it's gonna say you wrecked your ship and

0:40:49.260,0:40:53.460
then the game is gonna keep playing and

0:40:51.150,0:40:56.040
it's gonna say that every two seconds as

0:40:53.460,0:40:58.530
you like continue to wreck your ship now

0:40:56.040,0:41:02.849
what I would rather do is I would rather

0:40:58.530,0:41:07.200
just have the game stopped so maybe you

0:41:02.849,0:41:09.599
remember how to make the game stop so to

0:41:07.200,0:41:12.930
make the game just stop that's over in

0:41:09.599,0:41:17.940
control and the very very very bottom

0:41:12.930,0:41:20.910
command in the control is stop now again

0:41:17.940,0:41:23.010
stop all is a dangerous command and you

0:41:20.910,0:41:25.530
want to put it in just the right spot so

0:41:23.010,0:41:27.359
you'll notice it's in this advanced area

0:41:25.530,0:41:30.119
because if you put it in the wrong spot

0:41:27.359,0:41:33.210
it was very badly right and so it should

0:41:30.119,0:41:35.339
be fine because I've got it inside of my

0:41:33.210,0:41:38.880
if statement so I'm going to only stop

0:41:35.339,0:41:40.530
all if I say you wrecked your ship and

0:41:38.880,0:41:42.720
then stop all if you put it anywhere

0:41:40.530,0:41:46.410
else it's kind of just be a disaster

0:41:42.720,0:41:48.030
right so that's losing and you could

0:41:46.410,0:41:50.220
test that if you wanted so now if you

0:41:48.030,0:41:53.700
hit the island it says you wrecked your

0:41:50.220,0:41:55.250
ship for two seconds maybe I'll bump it

0:41:53.700,0:41:57.040
up a little bit maybe I'll say it for

0:41:55.250,0:41:58.300
loops

0:41:57.040,0:42:00.610
it's not their own place to bump it up

0:41:58.300,0:42:05.230
maybe I'll bump it up done five seconds

0:42:00.610,0:42:08.890
or something that's loss right let's do

0:42:05.230,0:42:10.270
win so when you win we're gonna start

0:42:08.890,0:42:15.850
off by doing the same thing we're going

0:42:10.270,0:42:19.090
to start off by saying a message so

0:42:15.850,0:42:23.140
we're gonna say well I could really put

0:42:19.090,0:42:27.240
it down in there so we're gonna say

0:42:23.140,0:42:27.240
instead of hello I'm gonna say you win

0:42:28.050,0:42:32.740
and I choose to make it seem like the

0:42:31.120,0:42:36.670
ship is saying it so I'm gonna have it

0:42:32.740,0:42:38.980
say with a rectangular speech bubble and

0:42:36.670,0:42:41.050
the font size of 18 for a regular speech

0:42:38.980,0:42:44.950
bubble is too small I'm gonna go with 48

0:42:41.050,0:42:47.650
again now this is a bit harder to test

0:42:44.950,0:42:50.830
in your game so really the only good way

0:42:47.650,0:42:54.550
to to test it is to either actually win

0:42:50.830,0:42:57.280
your game or come up with a clever way

0:42:54.550,0:43:01.360
to cheat right now a clever way to cheat

0:42:57.280,0:43:03.760
would be to change that X&Y so there it

0:43:01.360,0:43:06.190
says you win right to change that X&Y

0:43:03.760,0:43:08.380
that you start it out and then you could

0:43:06.190,0:43:11.680
cheat and you can get to your victory

0:43:08.380,0:43:14.440
much faster but it looks like mine is

0:43:11.680,0:43:16.180
working fine interestingly enough the

0:43:14.440,0:43:18.760
game doesn't stop so when you win you

0:43:16.180,0:43:21.130
just keep winning and tell eventually

0:43:18.760,0:43:25.750
you hit the island behind it right so

0:43:21.130,0:43:27.490
you win now we're not gonna stop if you

0:43:25.750,0:43:31.360
remember what the other game did when

0:43:27.490,0:43:33.820
you win it doubles your speed and then

0:43:31.360,0:43:36.370
you say let's play again right so here's

0:43:33.820,0:43:39.280
what we want to do we want to put the

0:43:36.370,0:43:42.790
ship back to the starting spot we want

0:43:39.280,0:43:45.790
to say let's go faster and then we want

0:43:42.790,0:43:47.110
to modify our variable so those that's

0:43:45.790,0:43:49.120
our goal let's go ahead and start doing

0:43:47.110,0:43:50.650
some of those things so what I want to

0:43:49.120,0:43:53.710
do is I want to go back to the starting

0:43:50.650,0:43:57.040
spot now I've got those numbers written

0:43:53.710,0:43:58.660
down and I could type a line of code

0:43:57.040,0:44:00.880
that's exactly like this but we can

0:43:58.660,0:44:03.700
actually do one better we can copy this

0:44:00.880,0:44:06.940
line of code down below so click on the

0:44:03.700,0:44:09.530
little black handle that's on the right

0:44:06.940,0:44:11.350
side of this and I want to copy

0:44:09.530,0:44:14.750
line of code so I'm going to hit

0:44:11.350,0:44:19.100
control-c I don't copy it and then

0:44:14.750,0:44:21.200
control V and it's command C and command

0:44:19.100,0:44:24.470
V if you're on Mac so now I've got a

0:44:21.200,0:44:29.140
duplicate of that line and now this line

0:44:24.470,0:44:32.330
I want to put down near the bottom right

0:44:29.140,0:44:33.890
so I'm going to say you win and they're

0:44:32.330,0:44:36.830
gonna enjoy their victory for two

0:44:33.890,0:44:40.790
seconds then I'm gonna snap them back to

0:44:36.830,0:44:54.590
the beginning and I'm gonna say let's go

0:44:40.790,0:44:57.710
faster let's go faster now this one just

0:44:54.590,0:45:00.740
to show it I had made as a bottom

0:44:57.710,0:45:02.450
message box in my example and what the

0:45:00.740,0:45:04.340
heck aw I'll just leave it as a bottom

0:45:02.450,0:45:06.050
message box or you can change it to

0:45:04.340,0:45:08.840
speech bubble that doesn't matter right

0:45:06.050,0:45:11.600
now when it's a bottom message box a

0:45:08.840,0:45:13.490
font size of 18 is actually fine so I'm

0:45:11.600,0:45:15.110
gonna just leave the defaults so the

0:45:13.490,0:45:17.450
only thing I did is I changed the text

0:45:15.110,0:45:19.700
and then I left it as a bottom message

0:45:17.450,0:45:23.330
box just so you can see it and I left

0:45:19.700,0:45:24.890
the font so that's wide now our code

0:45:23.330,0:45:28.130
right now does some of the things we

0:45:24.890,0:45:31.130
want it resets the ship to the start it

0:45:28.130,0:45:33.440
says let's go faster but it doesn't

0:45:31.130,0:45:35.480
actually go faster yet um

0:45:33.440,0:45:37.340
bow and how would we go faster do you

0:45:35.480,0:45:40.270
have any ideas for how how do you go

0:45:37.340,0:45:42.320
faster in this game you have any ideas

0:45:40.270,0:45:43.300
he gives you have any ideas for how we

0:45:42.320,0:45:48.620
go faster

0:45:43.300,0:45:51.110
sissie oh yeah set we could change speed

0:45:48.620,0:45:53.150
right so let's go into variable sissy so

0:45:51.110,0:45:58.400
what you're gonna say so we're gonna

0:45:53.150,0:46:01.880
change speed now there's a couple ways

0:45:58.400,0:46:04.220
to modify speed we we can use change

0:46:01.880,0:46:06.050
that would be one way to do it we could

0:46:04.220,0:46:08.600
change it by like 10 or something like

0:46:06.050,0:46:09.980
that if you wanted to do that you could

0:46:08.600,0:46:12.620
but I'm going to show you something

0:46:09.980,0:46:16.700
different so last time we showed you

0:46:12.620,0:46:19.250
change this time we're gonna set it in

0:46:16.700,0:46:23.500
an interesting way so go ahead and grab

0:46:19.250,0:46:27.520
a set and what we're going to do is

0:46:23.500,0:46:29.080
we're gonna set speed and what we want

0:46:27.520,0:46:31.780
to do is we want to set it to double

0:46:29.080,0:46:35.620
what it was before so speed is equal to

0:46:31.780,0:46:37.630
whatever speed was before times two now

0:46:35.620,0:46:39.670
you may notice that in variables there's

0:46:37.630,0:46:41.500
no like multiplication symbol in here

0:46:39.670,0:46:43.750
that's because multiplication and things

0:46:41.500,0:46:47.110
like that are over in the operators area

0:46:43.750,0:46:50.830
and what I want to do is I want to find

0:46:47.110,0:46:51.820
the operator for multiplication it's the

0:46:50.830,0:46:53.320
third one down

0:46:51.820,0:46:56.140
it's that itty-bitty star I know it's

0:46:53.320,0:46:59.560
hard to see and what we're gonna do is

0:46:56.140,0:47:01.930
we're going to set speed to the result

0:46:59.560,0:47:03.310
of some multiplication problem now zero

0:47:01.930,0:47:05.590
times zero is not a very good

0:47:03.310,0:47:06.670
multiplication problem instead what I

0:47:05.590,0:47:08.440
want to do is I want to set it to

0:47:06.670,0:47:11.650
whatever the speed was before so that's

0:47:08.440,0:47:18.310
over in variables so I drag a speed over

0:47:11.650,0:47:20.290
and put it right here speed times two so

0:47:18.310,0:47:24.520
you can read this line of code and it's

0:47:20.290,0:47:27.180
readable set speed to speed times two so

0:47:24.520,0:47:29.230
every time your speed is going to double

0:47:27.180,0:47:31.990
so folks I think we might have a

0:47:29.230,0:47:35.530
finished game here so we are ready to

0:47:31.990,0:47:37.840
try this we can lose and we can win and

0:47:35.530,0:47:40.420
we're ready to give this thing a go so

0:47:37.840,0:47:43.000
let's go ahead and try our game so I'm

0:47:40.420,0:47:45.160
gonna try an intentional loss first it

0:47:43.000,0:47:47.380
says you wrecked your ship and then the

0:47:45.160,0:47:50.410
game just ends right so nothing nothing

0:47:47.380,0:47:54.070
else happens and now I'm gonna try to

0:47:50.410,0:47:55.870
win one right so to win mine I've kind

0:47:54.070,0:48:03.160
of got two paths I've got the shortcut

0:47:55.870,0:48:05.740
path so there's a shortcut happen

0:48:03.160,0:48:08.710
remember is my speed is currently 10 and

0:48:05.740,0:48:11.920
then it says let's go faster and so now

0:48:08.710,0:48:13.540
I'm going I'm at 20 now the reason we're

0:48:11.920,0:48:16.000
doubling is because eventually it's

0:48:13.540,0:48:16.720
going to get too hard no matter how good

0:48:16.000,0:48:20.260
you are right

0:48:16.720,0:48:21.700
so my 20 is now at 40 and it doesn't

0:48:20.260,0:48:25.770
kind of start to freak out as it goes

0:48:21.700,0:48:32.080
like super fast right I'm gonna try 80 I

0:48:25.770,0:48:34.870
can do this do this you know now 160 is

0:48:32.080,0:48:37.750
hopeless right yeah

0:48:34.870,0:48:40.300
because it just goes crazy and so I

0:48:37.750,0:48:42.370
managed to make it up to 160 which is

0:48:40.300,0:48:44.620
pretty good right alright so you can

0:48:42.370,0:48:47.530
charge your adult and see if they can do

0:48:44.620,0:48:49.510
better than you so we're done with the

0:48:47.530,0:48:51.160
coding so now that I'm done with the

0:48:49.510,0:48:54.550
coding I'm gonna click on this little

0:48:51.160,0:49:00.490
down arrow and I'm gonna say publish to

0:48:54.550,0:49:02.350
community and publish to community -

0:49:00.490,0:49:05.110
ready to go now yours may not be ready

0:49:02.350,0:49:06.460
to go you may have a lot of people do

0:49:05.110,0:49:08.680
this you may have discovered that your

0:49:06.460,0:49:10.450
island was impossible to solve or he may

0:49:08.680,0:49:13.150
have discovered it was too too easy to

0:49:10.450,0:49:13.870
solve and your job is to make it fun

0:49:13.150,0:49:15.190
right

0:49:13.870,0:49:17.230
lipstick slick on the back here I didn't

0:49:15.190,0:49:20.080
mean to do that your job is to make it

0:49:17.230,0:49:22.630
fun so you're gonna have to tweak your

0:49:20.080,0:49:24.100
island so you should understand the

0:49:22.630,0:49:27.760
concepts now shooter got to tweak your

0:49:24.100,0:49:30.280
island maybe resize your ship all kinds

0:49:27.760,0:49:35.470
of things that you can do so that's the

0:49:30.280,0:49:38.200
goal now every day I want to see how my

0:49:35.470,0:49:39.670
campers are doing on the table campers

0:49:38.200,0:49:41.790
are you ready for me to see your project

0:49:39.670,0:49:44.020
or do you want me to give you a second

0:49:41.790,0:49:45.970
are you ready all right so I'm gonna go

0:49:44.020,0:49:47.920
around the table and I'm gonna see how

0:49:45.970,0:49:50.770
how my campers did just so we kind of

0:49:47.920,0:49:51.280
get some ideas there so Keegan is up

0:49:50.770,0:49:56.170
first

0:49:51.280,0:49:58.900
so Keegan chose to use a spaceship and

0:49:56.170,0:50:00.820
now he's sailing around his island now

0:49:58.900,0:50:02.500
Keegan what he's done to make his island

0:50:00.820,0:50:04.720
possible she's made a spaceship a little

0:50:02.500,0:50:06.880
smaller that's a very clever thing to do

0:50:04.720,0:50:10.630
so there you lose let's go and see you

0:50:06.880,0:50:12.010
win one Keegan - I just go yeah he's got

0:50:10.630,0:50:14.110
a shortcut misty we're get his cutting

0:50:12.010,0:50:20.110
board on the outside get down there and

0:50:14.110,0:50:21.670
win Keegan final come on Devon if you

0:50:20.110,0:50:25.510
like to win one for me and come back by

0:50:21.670,0:50:28.120
them all right Bowen has a cool line and

0:50:25.510,0:50:32.020
now he's bones use lots of stats so go

0:50:28.120,0:50:34.510
ahead and play it though all right so

0:50:32.020,0:50:38.140
he's got a sleepy dragon that's coming

0:50:34.510,0:50:40.110
around oh he caught that tip that's a

0:50:38.140,0:50:42.610
dangerous tip you've got their bow I

0:50:40.110,0:50:44.020
consider that a feature but you can

0:50:42.610,0:50:46.320
always change things until you're happy

0:50:44.020,0:50:46.320
with

0:50:47.349,0:50:54.109
it's a dangerous game all right good job

0:50:52.070,0:50:56.150
see if you can win your game and then

0:50:54.109,0:50:58.580
we've got McKinley over here

0:50:56.150,0:51:01.010
McKinley Murray looks like it's Murray's

0:50:58.580,0:51:03.230
Island I got infected clear on there

0:51:01.010,0:51:06.440
sorry Michael it looks like she's got a

0:51:03.230,0:51:07.790
ship that's sailing around I mean right

0:51:06.440,0:51:08.589
now she's doing a speed of 10 it looks

0:51:07.790,0:51:10.849
great

0:51:08.589,0:51:14.740
so campers did you have fun with today's

0:51:10.849,0:51:17.480
exercise all right if you want more

0:51:14.740,0:51:21.530
here's what we've done in the past we

0:51:17.480,0:51:24.349
have encouraged people to try to build

0:51:21.530,0:51:27.500
one on their own from scratch that's the

0:51:24.349,0:51:30.170
same coding concepts but a different

0:51:27.500,0:51:32.900
theme so I'm not gonna work this with

0:51:30.170,0:51:34.790
you but see if if you if you would like

0:51:32.900,0:51:38.000
another thing to do see if you can make

0:51:34.790,0:51:40.790
a very similar game with a different

0:51:38.000,0:51:43.910
theme so here I'm doing a space-themed

0:51:40.790,0:51:47.690
right so I used a spaceship and I drew

0:51:43.910,0:51:51.140
planets and I chose to use a little

0:51:47.690,0:51:52.609
earth image that I that I found but it's

0:51:51.140,0:51:56.089
still the same thing if I touch one of

0:51:52.609,0:51:58.550
these colors Iraq and if I touch the the

0:51:56.089,0:51:59.869
green that's in the home I win I also

0:51:58.550,0:52:02.480
decorated this one with a little alien

0:51:59.869,0:52:03.500
men all right so that's all we've got

0:52:02.480,0:52:05.960
for today

0:52:03.500,0:52:08.030
we hope you had fun with it I think

0:52:05.960,0:52:09.260
today's was a great example I builds on

0:52:08.030,0:52:11.030
yesterday and it's gonna build for what

0:52:09.260,0:52:13.210
we do tomorrow and we'll see you next

0:52:11.030,0:52:17.219
time
