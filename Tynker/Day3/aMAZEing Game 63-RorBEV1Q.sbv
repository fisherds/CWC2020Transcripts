0:00:03.740,0:00:08.940
hey hey welcome back it's day three

0:00:06.810,0:00:10.590
starting to kind of get a rhythm which

0:00:08.940,0:00:13.410
is fun I think we've got a really good

0:00:10.590,0:00:15.540
app for you today as well I wanted to

0:00:13.410,0:00:18.180
first introduce my my crew that was with

0:00:15.540,0:00:20.490
me yesterday I forgot but they are

0:00:18.180,0:00:22.740
they're still here so we got Keegan age

0:00:20.490,0:00:24.810
eight mommy and Bowen and working

0:00:22.740,0:00:26.910
together and then we've also got

0:00:24.810,0:00:29.640
McKinley but you guys want to say good

0:00:26.910,0:00:32.279
morning good morning you guys work this in the

0:00:29.640,0:00:34.200
morning right alright so let's go ahead

0:00:32.279,0:00:38.040
and show you what we're up to today

0:00:34.200,0:00:41.879
so today's mission so we are building a

0:00:38.040,0:00:42.809
game called amazing game that's a pun

0:00:41.879,0:00:44.570
alright

0:00:42.809,0:00:47.550
amazing game is what we're after today

0:00:44.570,0:00:50.340
and what we've got today is that you're

0:00:47.550,0:00:51.420
going to get some custom images from the

0:00:50.340,0:00:54.120
internet that's what we're going to

0:00:51.420,0:00:56.969
start with today to where you have a

0:00:54.120,0:00:59.609
hero so my hero in this case is the

0:00:56.969,0:01:00.870
pigeon a target that they're trying to

0:00:59.609,0:01:04.290
get to so I'm trying to get to the

0:01:00.870,0:01:06.450
hotdog and then also a villain and so my

0:01:04.290,0:01:08.850
villain in this case is the duckling

0:01:06.450,0:01:10.560
he's a sneaky duckling but your goal is

0:01:08.850,0:01:13.430
to get around the maze so you're gonna

0:01:10.560,0:01:16.110
have to draw the maze get to the hot dog

0:01:13.430,0:01:19.799
or whatever your target is to try to win

0:01:16.110,0:01:21.600
now I'm showing you this with with my

0:01:19.799,0:01:24.119
characters the pigeon the duckling and

0:01:21.600,0:01:26.670
the hot dog and so there he loses so he

0:01:24.119,0:01:27.479
has to go back to the start but what

0:01:26.670,0:01:30.780
you're going to do is you're going to

0:01:27.479,0:01:33.479
come up with your own things um in fact

0:01:30.780,0:01:36.270
you can probably do this first like

0:01:33.479,0:01:39.049
before we even get started today so like

0:01:36.270,0:01:42.689
with your adult think about three images

0:01:39.049,0:01:45.149
so you can either hero in this case it's

0:01:42.689,0:01:47.340
my pigeon you need the target that your

0:01:45.149,0:01:49.770
hero is trying to get to and then you

0:01:47.340,0:01:51.270
need some villain that's gonna be like

0:01:49.770,0:01:54.750
zooming around the screen trying to do

0:01:51.270,0:01:59.040
things so hopefully with a little bit of

0:01:54.750,0:02:02.549
adult supervision open up Google and

0:01:59.040,0:02:05.790
decide what you want to search for so

0:02:02.549,0:02:07.469
I'm gonna make mine today with a

0:02:05.790,0:02:09.660
different theme just because it can be

0:02:07.469,0:02:11.009
whatever theme you want right and so I'm

0:02:09.660,0:02:13.110
gonna make mine with kind of like a

0:02:11.009,0:02:13.860
veggie tales theme you can tell what we

0:02:13.110,0:02:15.570
watch

0:02:13.860,0:02:16.770
around town we did the mo Williams 

0:02:15.570,0:02:19.350
example there we watched Mo

0:02:16.770,0:02:21.960
Williams on YouTube and then VeggieTales

0:02:19.350,0:02:24.150
so the way you find a good image is

0:02:21.960,0:02:25.380
you put in the thing you want to find so

0:02:24.150,0:02:25.980
I want to find Larryboy from

0:02:25.380,0:02:27.840
VeggieTales

0:02:25.980,0:02:29.520
now just searching the internet maybe

0:02:27.840,0:02:31.590
you'll find a good image but 

0:02:29.520,0:02:33.750
perhaps not so you want to filter those

0:02:31.590,0:02:36.150
results by clicking on the word images

0:02:33.750,0:02:39.060
in Google now I've got a lot of images I

0:02:36.150,0:02:41.190
can do one better though I want an image

0:02:39.060,0:02:43.170
with a transparent background because I

0:02:41.190,0:02:45.120
don't want rectangles going around my

0:02:43.170,0:02:48.590
screen so what I'm going to do is I'm

0:02:45.120,0:02:51.690
gonna click on tools and then color

0:02:48.590,0:02:54.600
transparent now what this is going to do

0:02:51.690,0:02:57.360
whoops what this is going to do is this

0:02:54.600,0:02:59.580
is going to filter those results for

0:02:57.360,0:03:01.620
ones with transparent backgrounds so I'm

0:02:59.580,0:03:03.600
gonna find one that I like maybe I like

0:03:01.620,0:03:06.030
this one right here the best and click

0:03:03.600,0:03:07.560
on it and then I need to save this to my

0:03:06.030,0:03:12.030
computer so I'm just gonna right click

0:03:07.560,0:03:13.800
and say save image as and you can see

0:03:12.030,0:03:15.990
that I've actually prepared this in

0:03:13.800,0:03:18.750
advance so I chose to save three images

0:03:15.990,0:03:21.660
I chose to save a LarryBoy a bob and a

0:03:18.750,0:03:23.489
Moetato change the file names

0:03:21.660,0:03:25.230
because they always come down as crazy

0:03:23.489,0:03:27.360
file names to where it's a nice simple

0:03:25.230,0:03:30.180
name then that way when you import it

0:03:27.360,0:03:33.330
into Tynker you'll be all set so pause

0:03:30.180,0:03:36.840
the video and get yourself three images

0:03:33.330,0:03:38.610
a hero a villain and a target which I've

0:03:36.840,0:03:40.260
already done and then once you've got

0:03:38.610,0:03:42.260
those saved to your computer then come

0:03:40.260,0:03:44.850
back so pause it and go do that

0:03:42.260,0:03:46.560
everybody got their images alright

0:03:44.850,0:03:50.070
so now everybody's got their images

0:03:46.560,0:03:51.780
now let's bring them into Tynker so I

0:03:50.070,0:03:54.150
guess what I need to do first is I need

0:03:51.780,0:03:56.459
to go create a new project so create a

0:03:54.150,0:03:58.019
new project you can click on blank

0:03:56.459,0:03:59.640
project that works fine but I always

0:03:58.019,0:04:03.450
like to click on blank block coding

0:03:59.640,0:04:06.660
project I'm 99.99% sure they're the same

0:04:03.450,0:04:09.090
but I still click on blank block coding

0:04:06.660,0:04:12.000
project now inside of here I've

0:04:09.090,0:04:13.709
currently got my monster I don't need my

0:04:12.000,0:04:15.090
monster so I'm just going to delete him

0:04:13.709,0:04:19.440
so I clicked on the little three dots

0:04:15.090,0:04:21.690
and delete and so now he's gone now what

0:04:19.440,0:04:23.370
I want to do is I want to add my actors

0:04:21.690,0:04:27.740
one at a time so I'm gonna click on add

0:04:23.370,0:04:29.780
actor I'm gonna click on upload actor

0:04:27.740,0:04:31.099
and I'm gonna go find where on my

0:04:29.780,0:04:32.690
computer I saved them

0:04:31.099,0:04:35.270
probably it's easiest just to put them

0:04:32.690,0:04:37.759
right into your downloads folder so here

0:04:35.270,0:04:40.160
I'm gonna bring in Larry boy when you

0:04:37.759,0:04:43.270
bring in an image they may come in like

0:04:40.160,0:04:46.610
jumbo right so my larry boy came in huge

0:04:43.270,0:04:48.949
just grab the handles and shrink them

0:04:46.610,0:04:50.810
down to a good size Larry Boy is gonna

0:04:48.949,0:04:52.759
be walking through the maze and so just

0:04:50.810,0:04:54.410
like the ship yesterday if I make him

0:04:52.759,0:04:58.160
just kind of small that I can make a

0:04:54.410,0:05:01.610
more complex maze right next up I want

0:04:58.160,0:05:04.009
to upload I'll do my target so Larry boy

0:05:01.610,0:05:06.650
is trying to get to Bob I thought about

0:05:04.009,0:05:08.810
trying to to bring in Bob and then I

0:05:06.650,0:05:10.280
could kind of like put him in jail maybe

0:05:08.810,0:05:11.630
or something like that I don't know

0:05:10.280,0:05:14.690
maybe I'll do that as a feature but he's

0:05:11.630,0:05:16.819
trying to get to Bob you can start your

0:05:14.690,0:05:19.069
hero wherever you like but usually I

0:05:16.819,0:05:20.360
like to do some corner right so I'll do

0:05:19.069,0:05:22.610
the lower left corner of where he's

0:05:20.360,0:05:25.370
starting and then my target I don't know

0:05:22.610,0:05:27.590
I'll move him around later and then I

0:05:25.370,0:05:29.810
also need my villain so I'm gonna say

0:05:27.590,0:05:31.759
upload actor and I'm gonna bring in my

0:05:29.810,0:05:35.599
villain who if you happen to know

0:05:31.759,0:05:36.830
VeggieTales is moetato and I kind of

0:05:35.599,0:05:40.729
like for my villain to be a little

0:05:36.830,0:05:44.419
bigger and makes them scary right and so

0:05:40.729,0:05:46.759
that is what you need to do to kind of

0:05:44.419,0:05:49.430
get yourself set up and you need to size

0:05:46.759,0:05:51.590
your images just to give you

0:05:49.430,0:05:54.620
some ideas I'm gonna see what the

0:05:51.590,0:05:57.889
family has decided to do so Keegan

0:05:54.620,0:05:59.900
what what is your theme today minions he

0:05:57.889,0:06:07.300
likes minions so who's your hero your

0:05:59.900,0:06:10.099
villain and your target okay and he's

0:06:07.300,0:06:22.370
trying to get to the party Bowen what's

0:06:10.099,0:06:24.919
your theme today cool they're all geckos 

0:06:22.370,0:06:27.830
you've got a good gecko theme going evil

0:06:24.919,0:06:31.699
gecko he looked really evil and McKinley

0:06:27.830,0:06:34.539
what's your theme so we've got a horse

0:06:31.699,0:06:34.539
yeah

0:06:35.910,0:06:40.500
avoid the mountain lion that's a

0:06:38.250,0:06:43.680
good plan alright so you guys have your

0:06:40.500,0:06:45.540
images you brought them into tynker and

0:06:43.680,0:06:47.870
we're ready to start doing some stuff

0:06:45.540,0:06:51.690
with them that sounds great

0:06:47.870,0:06:53.700
alright alright so let's dive in and get

0:06:51.690,0:06:55.200
started first I'm gonna make my stage

0:06:53.700,0:06:57.120
just a little smaller just so I've got a

0:06:55.200,0:06:59.460
little more screen real estate I also

0:06:57.120,0:07:01.080
want to save my game so you can title

0:06:59.460,0:07:05.280
yours whatever you'd like

0:07:01.080,0:07:10.560
I call this amazing game because it's a

0:07:05.280,0:07:12.420
pun and I like puns I could go ahead and

0:07:10.560,0:07:17.240
publish it now but I'm not going to but

0:07:12.420,0:07:19.710
this is connecting with code 2020 day 3

0:07:17.240,0:07:22.530
so I'll just hit save for now and then

0:07:19.710,0:07:25.260
later I'll publish it alright so we've

0:07:22.530,0:07:28.230
got to decide where we want to start we

0:07:25.260,0:07:30.780
could start by drawing some of the the

0:07:28.230,0:07:33.240
grid like maze oh I forgot to mention on

0:07:30.780,0:07:35.220
that grid like maze if you try to walk

0:07:33.240,0:07:36.720
through the walls it doesn't let you

0:07:35.220,0:07:38.520
right so you can't walk through the

0:07:36.720,0:07:40.860
walls so we have to add code to actually

0:07:38.520,0:07:43.020
enforce not going through walls so we

0:07:40.860,0:07:45.390
could draw the maze first we could do

0:07:43.020,0:07:45.930
our hero walking around first it doesn't

0:07:45.390,0:07:48.720
really matter

0:07:45.930,0:07:51.240
I like code so let's start with code so

0:07:48.720,0:07:54.090
find your hero so the hero for me is

0:07:51.240,0:07:56.520
Larry Boy and I'm gonna click on Larry

0:07:54.090,0:07:58.020
Boy and I can see that I'm gonna start

0:07:56.520,0:08:00.780
editing his code because I've got my

0:07:58.020,0:08:03.180
little icon in here so what I want to do

0:08:00.780,0:08:05.280
with Larry Boy is we will have an on

0:08:03.180,0:08:07.710
start in a minute but instead we're

0:08:05.280,0:08:11.580
gonna move him with arrows so I'm gonna

0:08:07.710,0:08:13.410
bring over when up arrow pressed and

0:08:11.580,0:08:14.520
let's go and add some code to it and

0:08:13.410,0:08:17.220
then we'll duplicate it because we're

0:08:14.520,0:08:18.840
gonna do it like 4 times right so after

0:08:17.220,0:08:22.290
we press the up arrow we want some

0:08:18.840,0:08:24.570
motion to happen the motion that we want

0:08:22.290,0:08:27.000
to happen is we want Larry boy or

0:08:24.570,0:08:28.860
whoever our hero is to move up 10 pixels

0:08:27.000,0:08:31.350
there's a couple ways we could do that

0:08:28.860,0:08:33.930
one way is we can do this like change Y

0:08:31.350,0:08:35.849
by 10 pixels but we're gonna do it

0:08:33.930,0:08:39.479
different we're gonna point in that

0:08:35.849,0:08:42.450
direction so we need point in Direction

0:08:39.479,0:08:43.500
90 degrees and the reason we're pointing

0:08:42.450,0:08:45.270
by the way this is just kind of a

0:08:43.500,0:08:47.160
spoiler alert is because whenever we hit a

0:08:45.270,0:08:49.329
wall we want to go the opposite

0:08:47.160,0:08:51.160
direction so keeping track of which way

0:08:49.329,0:08:52.839
pointing is going to help us keep track

0:08:51.160,0:08:54.429
of which way we bounce backwards right

0:08:52.839,0:08:55.089
so we're going to point in that

0:08:54.429,0:08:57.369
direction

0:08:55.089,0:09:01.600
now right now it says point in direction

0:08:57.369,0:09:03.369
90 but we want the up arrow to go up and

0:09:01.600,0:09:07.029
so we actually want to click on this

0:09:03.369,0:09:10.749
circle to the up arrow and in in Tynker

0:09:07.029,0:09:13.299
up is zero degrees which again scratch

0:09:10.749,0:09:16.480
is different but I'm sure that it

0:09:13.299,0:09:18.100
doesn't really matter that much and then

0:09:16.480,0:09:20.769
the next thing we want to do is we want

0:09:18.100,0:09:25.569
to go to the top command and grab a move

0:09:20.769,0:09:28.029
10 pixels great and one thing that I

0:09:25.569,0:09:29.619
like to do when I code it's got a fancy

0:09:28.029,0:09:32.049
name it's called iterative enhancements

0:09:29.619,0:09:35.829
I like to test it whenever I can so

0:09:32.049,0:09:36.689
right now if I start my game and I hit

0:09:35.829,0:09:40.179
the up arrow

0:09:36.689,0:09:41.739
LarryBoy should go up now one thing did

0:09:40.179,0:09:45.189
happen that might have been surprising

0:09:41.739,0:09:47.889
to you is my LarryBoy actually turned

0:09:45.189,0:09:51.249
right so I hit play and then I hit up

0:09:47.889,0:09:53.589
arrow and my LarryBoy turned well I

0:09:51.249,0:09:55.869
actually didn't want him to turn so I

0:09:53.589,0:09:56.980
want to fix that so we wrote just a

0:09:55.869,0:09:59.529
little bit of code and it's already got

0:09:56.980,0:10:03.399
a bug here's how we're gonna fix it

0:09:59.529,0:10:05.889
we're gonna set his rotation style to

0:10:03.399,0:10:08.199
where the image doesn't rotate if that

0:10:05.889,0:10:14.529
makes sense the way we do that is to go

0:10:08.199,0:10:16.059
to events we grab an on start so we

0:10:14.529,0:10:18.279
almost always have some kind of on

0:10:16.059,0:10:20.259
start and then we want to go looking for

0:10:18.279,0:10:23.350
a very like obscure command

0:10:20.259,0:10:24.850
it's called set rotation style and we

0:10:23.350,0:10:26.649
want to set his rotation style to

0:10:24.850,0:10:28.239
doesn't rotate there's multiple ways we

0:10:26.649,0:10:31.329
can do this but I like to do it via code

0:10:28.239,0:10:34.720
so go to motion and let's go looking for

0:10:31.329,0:10:39.850
this odd command right here set rotation

0:10:34.720,0:10:42.549
style and we can set the rotation style

0:10:39.850,0:10:45.220
to all around which is the default which

0:10:42.549,0:10:46.989
is what he is now left right which our

0:10:45.220,0:10:51.189
monster did that on like the very first

0:10:46.989,0:10:53.739
day or don't rotate and I actually want

0:10:51.189,0:10:56.470
him the image I want the image to don't

0:10:53.739,0:10:58.240
rotate so if I run it again now and I

0:10:56.470,0:11:00.309
hit up arrow you can see that he kind of

0:10:58.240,0:11:02.619
goes up and he doesn't rotate and that's

0:11:00.309,0:11:03.250
going to work out better now if you try

0:11:02.619,0:11:04.450
to go left and

0:11:03.250,0:11:05.830
right he's not gonna do that if you're

0:11:04.450,0:11:08.440
trying to come back down he's not gonna

0:11:05.830,0:11:11.710
do that either right and so we need to

0:11:08.440,0:11:14.470
add those other things I find the

0:11:11.710,0:11:21.130
easiest way to add it is to click on up

0:11:14.470,0:11:24.610
arrow do a ctrl C a control V and that

0:11:21.130,0:11:27.400
will copy it and paste it and then you

0:11:24.610,0:11:31.600
have to do all four directions right so

0:11:27.400,0:11:35.440
maybe I'll do left arrow and I want the

0:11:31.600,0:11:39.190
left arrow to make me point in the left

0:11:35.440,0:11:41.920
direction so negative 90 in this case so

0:11:39.190,0:11:44.140
see if you can do the next two without

0:11:41.920,0:11:47.050
me it should be a pretty clear pattern

0:11:44.140,0:11:49.240
so go ahead and pause the video and see

0:11:47.050,0:11:55.480
if you can get all the different

0:11:49.240,0:11:57.730
directions worked all right so if you

0:11:55.480,0:12:00.160
paused it and tried it you should come

0:11:57.730,0:12:03.250
up with commands that look like this

0:12:00.160,0:12:05.800
so you should have up down right and

0:12:03.250,0:12:08.260
left and then of course you want to try

0:12:05.800,0:12:09.670
it to make sure it works there could be

0:12:08.260,0:12:12.430
all kinds of little things that are

0:12:09.670,0:12:16.030
wrong but you should have up go up down

0:12:12.430,0:12:18.610
go down right goes right and left goes

0:12:16.030,0:12:21.040
left and in addition to moving he's also

0:12:18.610,0:12:23.170
like pointing in that direction but the

0:12:21.040,0:12:27.580
image isn't rotating that and that works

0:12:23.170,0:12:28.839
out good later right by the way just to

0:12:27.580,0:12:30.700
kind of mention some little mistakes

0:12:28.839,0:12:32.560
that you can make maybe you clicked off

0:12:30.700,0:12:34.660
and it's 175 or something like that

0:12:32.560,0:12:36.640
that's okay it's not the end of the

0:12:34.660,0:12:39.190
world you can't actually just type in

0:12:36.640,0:12:41.290
this box though it's just a giant pain

0:12:39.190,0:12:45.640
because it tries to like autocomplete um

0:12:41.290,0:12:47.110
so do the best you can with it but I'm

0:12:45.640,0:12:49.210
trying to make sure that they do end up

0:12:47.110,0:12:51.250
at these different degrees I had trouble

0:12:49.210,0:12:53.680
typing in it there but make sure you've

0:12:51.250,0:12:56.110
got motion ready to go all right so now

0:12:53.680,0:12:58.360
we've got our hero's ability to move I

0:12:56.110,0:13:01.960
think what I'd like to do next is go

0:12:58.360,0:13:03.940
tackle the drawing the drawing step so

0:13:01.960,0:13:05.500
in order to do some drawing we're going

0:13:03.940,0:13:07.930
to have to create a background on our

0:13:05.500,0:13:11.589
stage so our stage has no backgrounds or

0:13:07.930,0:13:13.150
anything so click on the gear icon for

0:13:11.589,0:13:17.139
the stage so this little gear that's

0:13:13.150,0:13:19.299
right over here for the background

0:13:17.139,0:13:20.649
what we want to do I'm sorry for the

0:13:19.299,0:13:24.389
stage what we want to do is add a background

0:13:20.649,0:13:27.220
so go and click on add background and

0:13:24.389,0:13:29.439
then we want to draw a background from

0:13:27.220,0:13:32.519
scratch so we're not using using

0:13:29.439,0:13:35.799
anything at all so click on the little

0:13:32.519,0:13:37.209
art paintbrush up here or draw an image and

0:13:35.799,0:13:38.649
then you have to click again on draw an

0:13:37.209,0:13:41.139
image I always think that's silly that

0:13:38.649,0:13:42.730
you draw twice all right so now we're

0:13:41.139,0:13:44.709
gonna do some drawing now what I'm gonna

0:13:42.730,0:13:46.660
be careful of to begin with is I'm gonna

0:13:44.709,0:13:48.339
be careful to make sure that my zoom

0:13:46.660,0:13:50.199
level is such that I can see the whole

0:13:48.339,0:13:51.609
board because the first thing I want to

0:13:50.199,0:13:54.489
do is I want to put a ring around the

0:13:51.609,0:13:56.499
outside and if I've accidentally zoomed

0:13:54.489,0:13:57.939
in because I do this all the time and I

0:13:56.499,0:14:00.609
draw a ring here on the outside it's not

0:13:57.939,0:14:02.019
really around the outside right now what

0:14:00.609,0:14:04.839
I want to do is I want to pick what

0:14:02.019,0:14:07.689
color my maze is gonna be sometimes it

0:14:04.839,0:14:09.850
can be thematic to your characters but

0:14:07.689,0:14:12.669
it also it can be nice if you pick a

0:14:09.850,0:14:15.459
color that isn't likely to appear in

0:14:12.669,0:14:17.079
your characters that's not a big deal

0:14:15.459,0:14:20.139
but pick a color that you think would be

0:14:17.079,0:14:21.759
fun so mine are kind of VeggieTales I

0:14:20.139,0:14:23.799
think that VeggieTales I think of green

0:14:21.759,0:14:25.749
when I think of VeggieTales so I'm gonna

0:14:23.799,0:14:29.679
pick kind of like a greenish color for

0:14:25.749,0:14:31.600
my maze today hopefully that's not the

0:14:29.679,0:14:33.489
exact same shade of green as something

0:14:31.600,0:14:34.809
in LarryBoy but I'll risk it now

0:14:33.489,0:14:36.369
what I want to do first is I want to

0:14:34.809,0:14:40.509
draw a rectangle around the whole

0:14:36.369,0:14:43.119
perimeter so to draw rectangles it's

0:14:40.509,0:14:46.209
actually a shape which is under the line

0:14:43.119,0:14:49.269
tool and what I want to do is I want a

0:14:46.209,0:14:52.209
hollow rectangle now this hollow

0:14:49.269,0:14:54.939
rectangle has a transparent middle and

0:14:52.209,0:14:57.730
then a border around the outside I'm

0:14:54.939,0:14:59.919
gonna make the size of mine be 10 just

0:14:57.730,0:15:04.149
so it's a slightly bigger border and I'm

0:14:59.919,0:15:05.860
gonna make the opacity be 100% it's kind

0:15:04.149,0:15:09.220
of nice to make your walls a little

0:15:05.860,0:15:12.220
thicker so I think a nice 10 pixel wall would look nice

0:15:09.220,0:15:14.049
other than just like a really thin wall now

0:15:12.220,0:15:17.559
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna draw it

0:15:14.049,0:15:18.220
to where it's pretty close to as big as

0:15:17.559,0:15:20.679
it can get

0:15:18.220,0:15:23.559
now if you do a perfect job then that's

0:15:20.679,0:15:25.299
great but I don't want you to worry

0:15:23.559,0:15:28.839
about doing a perfect job because what

0:15:25.299,0:15:30.800
happens is this once you draw it you

0:15:28.839,0:15:33.260
have a little bit of a chance to move it

0:15:30.800,0:15:35.750
around until you let go of it so if

0:15:33.260,0:15:38.660
you make it so I did perfect on the top

0:15:35.750,0:15:42.019
and the right and the bottom but my left

0:15:38.660,0:15:46.370
needs to be adjusted over here now if

0:15:42.019,0:15:48.410
you did not even close to perfect right

0:15:46.370,0:15:50.839
that's fine too so I'm just gonna do

0:15:48.410,0:15:52.459
mine again so let's say that I did this

0:15:50.839,0:15:55.790
right so it wasn't even close to perfect

0:15:52.459,0:15:57.890
I could just move everyone out to get it

0:15:55.790,0:16:00.620
perfect now if you made it really really

0:15:57.890,0:16:02.630
small then this is gonna make it look a

0:16:00.620,0:16:06.500
little stretchy but as long as you're

0:16:02.630,0:16:08.420
close it should work out fine so that is

0:16:06.500,0:16:10.550
my wall that's gonna make sure that

0:16:08.420,0:16:13.089
everybody stays in bounds you can't just

0:16:10.550,0:16:15.350
like go outside the maze and do stuff

0:16:13.089,0:16:19.040
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm

0:16:15.350,0:16:20.660
going to switch to use the line tool now

0:16:19.040,0:16:22.700
for the line tool I'm gonna continue to

0:16:20.660,0:16:25.519
use the same color I'm going to continue

0:16:22.700,0:16:28.339
to use ten pixels in full opacity and

0:16:25.519,0:16:31.279
I'm gonna draw my maze now here's where

0:16:28.339,0:16:33.920
the creative part comes in you have to

0:16:31.279,0:16:36.649
draw a maze to where your hero has to

0:16:33.920,0:16:39.140
like get through the maze and get to the

0:16:36.649,0:16:40.490
target and it has to be possible right

0:16:39.140,0:16:43.190
so you have to think about how big your

0:16:40.490,0:16:45.050
sprite is and there has to be a path by

0:16:43.190,0:16:47.480
which they can get through it doesn't have

0:16:45.050,0:16:48.680
to be like a hard maze to solve but it

0:16:47.480,0:16:51.560
should be something that like provides

0:16:48.680,0:16:53.720
obstacles so that your villain can make

0:16:51.560,0:16:55.270
it hard right so what I'm going to do is

0:16:53.720,0:16:58.430
I always kind of like to start with a

0:16:55.270,0:17:01.700
little straight period up on the side

0:16:58.430,0:17:05.209
but you can do whatever you want and I'm

0:17:01.700,0:17:07.459
thinking about you know my hero and I

0:17:05.209,0:17:09.890
predict that he can probably get up this

0:17:07.459,0:17:13.100
shoot fine and then he can probably get

0:17:09.890,0:17:15.800
across the top there now after the

0:17:13.100,0:17:18.500
initial line you know I'm gonna maybe

0:17:15.800,0:17:20.300
make him go back down you can do

0:17:18.500,0:17:24.169
whatever you want so go ahead and take a

0:17:20.300,0:17:26.089
minute and draw your your maze right so

0:17:24.169,0:17:29.660
I'm just gonna kind of draw a pretty

0:17:26.089,0:17:32.630
simple maze and think about where your

0:17:29.660,0:17:34.130
your targets gonna be and you know think

0:17:32.630,0:17:35.900
about the fact that they have to get to

0:17:34.130,0:17:39.410
the target so I think I'm gonna put Bob

0:17:35.900,0:17:39.830
he's my target somewhere like inside of

0:17:39.410,0:17:42.040
here

0:17:39.830,0:17:42.040
right

0:17:43.120,0:17:47.110
and then after you draw a little bit

0:17:44.730,0:17:49.330
what you'll have to do is you'll have to

0:17:47.110,0:17:51.340
go check it like with your character and

0:17:49.330,0:17:54.160
see like where are they where they can

0:17:51.340,0:17:58.120
get through and where you've made a an

0:17:54.160,0:17:59.590
accidentally impossible game right so I

0:17:58.120,0:18:01.059
don't know maybe I'll try that one

0:17:59.590,0:18:02.710
and if you don't like something you put

0:18:01.059,0:18:09.160
in just do an undo on it

0:18:02.710,0:18:11.890
and just try again right and then once

0:18:09.160,0:18:14.380
you so I I may be done I don't really

0:18:11.890,0:18:17.530
know if I'm done or not I'm gonna go

0:18:14.380,0:18:19.840
back and I'm just gonna walk LarryBoy

0:18:17.530,0:18:22.120
around and I'm gonna see if I'm done

0:18:19.840,0:18:25.420
right so I'm just gonna kind of see yep

0:18:22.120,0:18:26.260
that seems kind of good yep I made it

0:18:25.420,0:18:27.970
through there ooh that was kind of

0:18:26.260,0:18:30.250
close that means that probably something

0:18:27.970,0:18:32.200
later is in trouble now if I do touch the

0:18:30.250,0:18:32.620
walls nothing bad is gonna happen to me

0:18:32.200,0:18:33.700
right now

0:18:32.620,0:18:35.920
right I'm just gonna go right through

0:18:33.700,0:18:39.400
them but this is where I kind of like

0:18:35.920,0:18:40.900
test my game and I see like this area is

0:18:39.400,0:18:43.570
probably too easy right so I'm probably

0:18:40.900,0:18:47.380
gonna make that a little harder and then

0:18:43.570,0:18:51.040
come around here and then that's

0:18:47.380,0:18:52.600
gonna be close so I make it try to make

0:18:51.040,0:18:54.850
sure you make it by more than just like

0:18:52.600,0:18:56.350
one pixel because our games gonna need a

0:18:54.850,0:18:58.300
little bit of freedom so I think that

0:18:56.350,0:19:01.650
mine actually wasn't too bad I think the

0:18:58.300,0:19:04.179
thing that I'm gonna do is I'm going to

0:19:01.650,0:19:06.250
edit it some more so I'm gonna click on

0:19:04.179,0:19:10.150
the pencil now and I'm gonna make one

0:19:06.250,0:19:16.600
spot harder right and so I'm gonna make

0:19:10.150,0:19:18.070
this spot right here harder all right so

0:19:16.600,0:19:20.020
I'm gonna walk around and help my

0:19:18.070,0:19:22.780
campers out a little bit but no reason

0:19:20.020,0:19:25.780
for you to see that so play around until

0:19:22.780,0:19:28.120
you're pretty happy with your maze and I

0:19:25.780,0:19:31.090
think that that mine looks looks pretty

0:19:28.120,0:19:32.950
good here alright so half an hour later

0:19:31.090,0:19:33.670
my teams got their mazes drawn just

0:19:32.950,0:19:36.700
just teasing

0:19:33.670,0:19:39.220
but Keegan's got an elaborate plan to

0:19:36.700,0:19:41.860
add things to his maze bow and Bowen you mind if

0:19:39.220,0:19:44.020
we see your maze it looks good good looking maze

0:19:41.860,0:19:45.670
Bowen and then of course McKinley

0:19:44.020,0:19:49.120
McKinley do you have a maze oh she's got an

0:19:45.670,0:19:52.770
elaborate maze so depending on on who

0:19:49.120,0:19:55.500
you are you might want to make it kind of simple 

0:19:52.770,0:19:57.900
or kind of complex or Keegan's got a

0:19:55.500,0:19:59.550
plan to add crazy stuff later but make

0:19:57.900,0:20:02.490
sure you've got a maze that you're happy

0:19:59.550,0:20:03.960
with the next thing we're going to do is

0:20:02.490,0:20:06.180
we're going to actually add some code

0:20:03.960,0:20:09.660
for our villain next so we're gonna kind

0:20:06.180,0:20:11.520
of do this in a weird order today so

0:20:09.660,0:20:13.680
what we want to do is if we want to add

0:20:11.520,0:20:16.350
code for our villain we have to select

0:20:13.680,0:20:19.200
our villain from the list so my villain

0:20:16.350,0:20:22.260
is moetato - and what moetato is gonna do

0:20:19.200,0:20:24.270
is he's gonna glide around the screen in

0:20:22.260,0:20:26.940
different places to make it harder for

0:20:24.270,0:20:28.560
LarryBoy to get to the target now this

0:20:26.940,0:20:31.500
does require a little bit of planning

0:20:28.560,0:20:33.780
right so you have to think about where

0:20:31.500,0:20:36.120
should he glide to kind of make a fun

0:20:33.780,0:20:38.820
game so obviously one of the places I'm

0:20:36.120,0:20:42.540
gonna glide is I'm gonna glide like into

0:20:38.820,0:20:44.220
this area and then back out and then

0:20:42.540,0:20:46.530
maybe I'll glide somewhere through the

0:20:44.220,0:20:48.330
bottom but it's kind of nice to come up

0:20:46.530,0:20:51.030
with a pattern you think will be kind of

0:20:48.330,0:20:54.960
fun so maybe I'll go over and back and

0:20:51.030,0:20:56.370
then maybe I'll go down and it doesn't

0:20:54.960,0:20:58.410
it doesn't really matter but if you have

0:20:56.370,0:21:01.170
some goal for where do you want your

0:20:58.410,0:21:04.260
villain to go that can actually

0:21:01.170,0:21:06.270
be be better and we're gonna need a

0:21:04.260,0:21:07.440
sheet of paper for this so I'm gonna

0:21:06.270,0:21:08.670
have to pause it and go get a sheet of

0:21:07.440,0:21:10.320
paper because I forgot to get a sheet of

0:21:08.670,0:21:11.940
paper and we're gonna pick some

0:21:10.320,0:21:13.650
different places that we want our

0:21:11.940,0:21:15.570
villain to go to and we're gonna write

0:21:13.650,0:21:17.880
down those positions so I'm gonna go get

0:21:15.570,0:21:19.770
my sheet of paper you should too alright

0:21:17.880,0:21:22.380
welcome back I got my paper so what

0:21:19.770,0:21:25.320
we're gonna do is I'm gonna write down

0:21:22.380,0:21:26.760
different positions for my villain so

0:21:25.320,0:21:28.230
I'm gonna get him where I want him

0:21:26.760,0:21:29.730
so right now I've kind of got him in the

0:21:28.230,0:21:31.800
middle by the way if you want your stage

0:21:29.730,0:21:34.380
bigger you can just click on the stage

0:21:31.800,0:21:36.720
tab and it'll make it bigger for you so

0:21:34.380,0:21:38.220
his first position here I kind of looked

0:21:36.720,0:21:40.080
down in the corner I can't move them

0:21:38.220,0:21:43.260
house though I just have to look it's

0:21:40.080,0:21:45.030
negative thirty-two and ninety and maybe

0:21:43.260,0:21:47.090
that's what he'll start first and so I'm

0:21:45.030,0:21:51.810
gonna take my pencil a number write down

0:21:47.090,0:21:53.640
negative looks like it moved to negative 28 91 so

0:21:51.810,0:21:55.320
I've written that down next I have to

0:21:53.640,0:21:57.360
pick a new spot for him so maybe I'll

0:21:55.320,0:21:59.010
move him over here next and I'll write

0:21:57.360,0:22:02.880
that number down so I'll just say that's

0:21:59.010,0:22:04.620
negative five five zero 52 again I'm

0:22:02.880,0:22:06.090
looking in that lower right corner I

0:22:04.620,0:22:06.300
can't move my mouse there because then

0:22:06.090,0:22:08.640
it'll change the

0:22:06.300,0:22:11.550
position so go around and get a few

0:22:08.640,0:22:13.590
positions where you want your villain to

0:22:11.550,0:22:17.190
glide to and he's gonna smoothly glide

0:22:13.590,0:22:20.040
between them so I've got mine I actually

0:22:17.190,0:22:21.690
just just did it already and I've got a

0:22:20.040,0:22:24.750
list here all right so let's go back to

0:22:21.690,0:22:27.120
our code so our code make sure you're

0:22:24.750,0:22:30.330
selecting your villain it's like this

0:22:27.120,0:22:31.920
it's gonna have an on start which we've

0:22:30.330,0:22:33.600
done a couple times so I did that kind

0:22:31.920,0:22:35.550
of quickly it's the first thing in the

0:22:33.600,0:22:38.570
first category we're going to do

0:22:35.550,0:22:42.900
something forever so I go into control I

0:22:38.570,0:22:45.690
find a forever loop and then what we're

0:22:42.900,0:22:50.220
gonna do is for each position we're

0:22:45.690,0:22:54.540
gonna bring over a glide to - so here's a

0:22:50.220,0:22:56.100
glide right here and what I like to do

0:22:54.540,0:22:59.190
is I like to put in the number of

0:22:56.100,0:23:01.830
commands that are necessary first so it

0:22:59.190,0:23:03.840
looks like I've got seven commands so

0:23:01.830,0:23:06.260
you can you know maybe you wrote down three

0:23:03.840,0:23:08.430
maybe you wrote down like thirty

0:23:06.260,0:23:10.050
probably I wouldn't do more than seven

0:23:08.430,0:23:11.610
seven is quite a few and now I'm just

0:23:10.050,0:23:15.000
gonna start typing in my numbers right

0:23:11.610,0:23:16.770
in general I like the glide to happen

0:23:15.000,0:23:19.860
over three seconds that's kind of a

0:23:16.770,0:23:21.390
smoother glide and what I do to hop

0:23:19.860,0:23:24.360
between them

0:23:21.390,0:23:26.940
is I hit tab you don't have to hit tab you

0:23:24.360,0:23:30.660
can click into each one that's fine tab

0:23:26.940,0:23:32.940
makes it go a little faster right and so

0:23:30.660,0:23:35.220
this is a good game for parents and kids

0:23:32.940,0:23:37.290
to do together so your write down all

0:23:35.220,0:23:40.920
your numbers and then you have the

0:23:37.290,0:23:42.420
parent hold the list and they just say

0:23:40.920,0:23:44.520
you know where am I supposed to go to

0:23:42.420,0:23:49.290
next and so you just tell them so I

0:23:44.520,0:23:51.690
think I've got mine almost done oops I tried

0:23:49.290,0:23:55.140
to do one a little too fast there so a

0:23:51.690,0:23:56.190
three there 571 maybe I'll speed up the

0:23:55.140,0:23:58.350
video to where you don't have to watch

0:23:56.190,0:24:01.020
me type every single number but I'm

0:23:58.350,0:24:04.800
almost there all right five two five so

0:24:01.020,0:24:06.870
pause the video and go at your speed you don't

0:24:04.800,0:24:08.520
have to go at my speed on things and

0:24:06.870,0:24:10.470
make sure you've got all your positions

0:24:08.520,0:24:12.180
right and then when you hit play

0:24:10.470,0:24:15.030
something kind of neat should happen is

0:24:12.180,0:24:17.730
your villain should glide around to

0:24:15.030,0:24:20.190
different positions now here's where

0:24:17.730,0:24:21.960
game design is important you 

0:24:20.190,0:24:23.970
have to make sure that your game is

0:24:21.960,0:24:28.769
playable and fun right

0:24:23.970,0:24:30.600
so for example with mine Larry might be

0:24:28.769,0:24:32.009
going a little too slow right by the way

0:24:30.600,0:24:34.200
I can still go through walls but we're

0:24:32.009,0:24:37.679
gonna fix that with our code but you

0:24:34.200,0:24:39.750
have to make sure that it's possible to

0:24:37.679,0:24:42.720
not only get through your maze but

0:24:39.750,0:24:44.549
possible to do it without hitting your

0:24:42.720,0:24:48.389
villain and the idea through your game

0:24:44.549,0:24:51.269
is ah with good strategy you could avoid

0:24:48.389,0:24:53.399
where your villain gets to so I think

0:24:51.269,0:24:56.250
it's wise to memorize where your villain

0:24:53.399,0:24:58.379
goes but you can actually like make sure

0:24:56.250,0:24:59.720
your game is playable so mine is gonna

0:24:58.379,0:25:02.580
be hard but I think

0:24:59.720,0:25:05.090
it's doable so I'm gonna give it a go

0:25:02.580,0:25:07.139
for now so I'm gonna call it good enough

0:25:05.090,0:25:09.269
the next thing I want to do just because

0:25:07.139,0:25:12.149
I was thinking about it is I want to

0:25:09.269,0:25:14.909
play with letting you change the speed

0:25:12.149,0:25:16.950
of your hero so right now the speed of

0:25:14.909,0:25:19.529
our hero is that every time there's a

0:25:16.950,0:25:21.029
press he moves 10 pixels now here's what

0:25:19.529,0:25:22.830
happens in coding all the time this is a

0:25:21.029,0:25:23.519
good lesson let's say I wanted him to go

0:25:22.830,0:25:25.440
faster

0:25:23.519,0:25:27.539
well I change this one to 15 well I've

0:25:25.440,0:25:30.269
got to change them all to 15 right so

0:25:27.539,0:25:32.279
I've got in my code you can just watch

0:25:30.269,0:25:34.860
for now I've got in my code the number

0:25:32.279,0:25:36.570
for his speed in four different places I

0:25:34.860,0:25:39.000
say oh I want to go faster than that I

0:25:36.570,0:25:42.000
want to actually go at 20 and if you

0:25:39.000,0:25:43.919
have this problem a lot where you've got

0:25:42.000,0:25:45.139
the same number in your code at multiple

0:25:43.919,0:25:48.149
places and you want them to all match it's

0:25:45.139,0:25:50.220
silly to have to change them in all four

0:25:48.149,0:25:52.950
places every time so we're gonna make a

0:25:50.220,0:25:54.720
variable this is a coding concept that

0:25:52.950,0:25:56.309
people use a lot it's called avoiding

0:25:54.720,0:25:57.779
magic numbers so I've got this magic

0:25:56.309,0:26:00.090
number in my code in four places

0:25:57.779,0:26:02.210
whenever that happens it's a good time

0:26:00.090,0:26:09.029
to make a variable so go to variables

0:26:02.210,0:26:11.509
and then click on create variable and I

0:26:09.029,0:26:14.190
like to call this variable speed and

0:26:11.509,0:26:15.899
speed is for only this actor now this

0:26:14.190,0:26:20.100
variable is different than we've ever

0:26:15.899,0:26:22.080
used variables before so this is going to avoid having a magic

0:26:20.100,0:26:23.970
number in many places it's not going to

0:26:22.080,0:26:26.909
change right so it's not ever going to

0:26:23.970,0:26:31.860
change we're going to set it once so I'm

0:26:26.909,0:26:34.029
gonna grab a set I'm gonna set the speed

0:26:31.860,0:26:36.759
once

0:26:34.029,0:26:38.590
and I'm just going to go and let you

0:26:36.759,0:26:40.539
look at what I did here I did that

0:26:38.590,0:26:42.429
little fast I'm gonna set it once and

0:26:40.539,0:26:46.509
then I'm gonna use it in multiple

0:26:42.429,0:26:48.549
different spots so I created this variable 15

0:26:46.509,0:26:50.919
and then I'm going to use it at all four

0:26:48.549,0:26:54.279
of these spots so instead of having this

0:26:50.919,0:26:58.119
magic number in four places I drop in

0:26:54.279,0:27:02.169
the variable speed into everywhere I use

0:26:58.119,0:27:05.049
it so this appears to be the exact same

0:27:02.169,0:27:08.169
code but it's better because now I can 

0:27:05.049,0:27:11.080
change the speed in one place and it

0:27:08.169,0:27:13.059
changes it everywhere it's pretty simple

0:27:11.080,0:27:15.609
to see the four places here but in code

0:27:13.059,0:27:17.830
it happens all the time where you do

0:27:15.609,0:27:20.789
things like this and so now I've got my

0:27:17.830,0:27:24.279
code to where it's easy to maintain

0:27:20.789,0:27:27.999
it doesn't repeat myself so that's dry

0:27:24.279,0:27:30.460
don't repeat yourself and I've avoided

0:27:27.999,0:27:33.519
the magic number of 20 appearing in

0:27:30.460,0:27:35.200
multiple places inside my code and you

0:27:33.519,0:27:36.669
can also play with your speed until you

0:27:35.200,0:27:39.219
think that your game is good and

0:27:36.669,0:27:41.529
possible oh I've got a vicious spot

0:27:39.219,0:27:44.259
there in my game oh I'll have to figure

0:27:41.529,0:27:46.539
that out I think 20 is fine for me but

0:27:44.259,0:27:49.929
you can go at whatever speed you would

0:27:46.539,0:27:52.570
like to go all right

0:27:49.929,0:27:55.029
good time to click on save right so

0:27:52.570,0:27:59.469
we've done done a lot of things now what

0:27:55.029,0:28:01.619
I want to do is I want to make Larry no

0:27:59.469,0:28:03.609
longer be able to pass through walls

0:28:01.619,0:28:06.039
adding this is going to make my game a

0:28:03.609,0:28:08.049
little harder to test but it's going to

0:28:06.039,0:28:13.059
be important to make Larry not pass

0:28:08.049,0:28:14.559
through walls so click on your hero this

0:28:13.059,0:28:15.999
is something we have to always check

0:28:14.559,0:28:17.769
we're gonna check am i touching a wall

0:28:15.999,0:28:21.429
am i touching a wall am i touching a

0:28:17.769,0:28:24.820
wall so that is a if statement that is

0:28:21.429,0:28:30.009
for inside of a forever loop so go to

0:28:24.820,0:28:34.529
control find a forever loop stick it on

0:28:30.009,0:28:37.899
to Larry's in his on start thread/block of code and

0:28:34.529,0:28:40.839
then he does a couple things forever but

0:28:37.899,0:28:45.099
one of them is he always checks am i

0:28:40.839,0:28:47.880
touching a wall now touching a wall is a

0:28:45.099,0:28:49.620
color so am i touching this color

0:28:47.880,0:28:50.940
now it's a good thing you got your

0:28:49.620,0:28:53.520
pencil and paper because we're about to

0:28:50.940,0:28:57.240
have to use it again right so we want to

0:28:53.520,0:28:59.850
know what color is my maze so I've got

0:28:57.240,0:29:01.620
to go back in and edit my maze I'm not

0:28:59.850,0:29:04.559
going to really edit it so that I can

0:29:01.620,0:29:05.610
figure out what color that green is so

0:29:04.559,0:29:08.730
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

0:29:05.610,0:29:10.049
click on the pencil for my stage and so

0:29:08.730,0:29:12.120
that pencil is going to take me into

0:29:10.049,0:29:13.470
edit mode for the stage and then I want

0:29:12.120,0:29:16.350
to figure out exactly what shade of

0:29:13.470,0:29:17.880
green did I use so this process we use

0:29:16.350,0:29:20.940
before but it takes a while to get it

0:29:17.880,0:29:24.750
down you click on the eyedropper you

0:29:20.940,0:29:28.230
click on the color then you click on the

0:29:24.750,0:29:32.010
color chooser and you want the hex value

0:29:28.230,0:29:34.380
I am sure that Tynker will make this

0:29:32.010,0:29:37.950
process better some day I'm 100%

0:29:34.380,0:29:40.710
convinced of it but today this is the

0:29:37.950,0:29:44.510
best way to get the color that I happen

0:29:40.710,0:29:48.659
to know of again colors will be numbers

0:29:44.510,0:29:50.730
and letters a through f and it can be hard to

0:29:48.659,0:29:52.980
tell the difference between like an O (letter)

0:29:50.730,0:29:54.720
and a zero but it's actually not hard

0:29:52.980,0:29:55.919
because you know it's a zero it can also

0:29:54.720,0:29:58.710
be hard to tell the difference between

0:29:55.919,0:30:01.440
like an eight and a B and now that one

0:29:58.710,0:30:04.919
is hard but get your number write it

0:30:01.440,0:30:06.390
down and then you can go back to your

0:30:04.919,0:30:10.049
code so you have to kind of like exit

0:30:06.390,0:30:12.270
the stage here and what I want to put in

0:30:10.049,0:30:15.659
here is I want to say if touching color

0:30:12.270,0:30:17.340
then do stuff touching color is a

0:30:15.659,0:30:20.580
sensing so you know it's gonna be in

0:30:17.340,0:30:26.640
sensing and I want touching color

0:30:20.580,0:30:29.340
it looks like it's the fourth one down click in

0:30:26.640,0:30:35.220
this box and type typing in this box can

0:30:29.340,0:30:37.289
be a little annoying

0:30:35.220,0:30:38.880
if you get it this is just like we did with with

0:30:37.289,0:30:40.950
other things if you get it you'll get a

0:30:38.880,0:30:43.350
confirmation that it worked because the

0:30:40.950,0:30:45.299
the background will change to that color

0:30:43.350,0:30:49.230
and so I can see that I have a match

0:30:45.299,0:30:52.500
between my maze green and my touching

0:30:49.230,0:30:54.179
color green here all right so once

0:30:52.500,0:30:55.860
you've got once you fought with it

0:30:54.179,0:30:57.450
enough to make that work I'd help my

0:30:55.860,0:31:00.179
campers out a little bit we're ready to

0:30:57.450,0:31:01.680
do stuff inside of this code so now he's

0:31:00.179,0:31:04.110
going to know hey I am touching this

0:31:01.680,0:31:05.850
color now I want something to happen so

0:31:04.110,0:31:08.910
the thing that I want to happen is I

0:31:05.850,0:31:11.670
want him to bounce off right so this is

0:31:08.910,0:31:13.800
where a little theatrics is good but

0:31:11.670,0:31:15.990
like if you walk and then you hit a wall

0:31:13.800,0:31:18.930
when you hit a wall you do a couple

0:31:15.990,0:31:20.700
things you turn around and then you take

0:31:18.930,0:31:21.450
a step backwards right and so that's

0:31:20.700,0:31:22.620
what we're going to do so the first

0:31:21.450,0:31:25.830
thing we're going to do when we hit a

0:31:22.620,0:31:27.750
wall is turn around so you turn around

0:31:25.830,0:31:30.210
we'll see how good people are with their

0:31:27.750,0:31:33.570
angles so we're gonna turn some number

0:31:30.210,0:31:35.430
of degrees to turn around

0:31:33.570,0:31:38.010
Keegan do you have any idea how many

0:31:35.430,0:31:42.900
degrees do I need to turn to turn

0:31:38.010,0:31:45.090
completely around I need to turn 

0:31:42.900,0:31:47.970
180 that's right so I need to turn 180

0:31:45.090,0:31:50.820
degrees and then I need to step away

0:31:47.970,0:31:56.760
from the wall the right number of pixels

0:31:50.820,0:31:58.500
so I'm going to use a move and now we

0:31:56.760,0:31:59.940
need to move away that magic number

0:31:58.500,0:32:05.100
again so that we kind of like bounce

0:31:59.940,0:32:07.770
back and so we need to move speed pixels

0:32:05.100,0:32:09.420
away right

0:32:07.770,0:32:11.310
maybe instead of speed I should have

0:32:09.420,0:32:13.680
called it like distance but that's okay so

0:32:11.310,0:32:15.930
I need to drop in to that instead of

0:32:13.680,0:32:18.990
move 10 pixels I need to move speed

0:32:15.930,0:32:20.220
pixels so I got to go to variables and I

0:32:18.990,0:32:23.580
got to take that speed and I've got to

0:32:20.220,0:32:25.290
drop it in now I could run it right now

0:32:23.580,0:32:27.840
and that would be a fine test but it's

0:32:25.290,0:32:30.900
gonna happen too fast because in 

0:32:27.840,0:32:32.400
Tynker if you touch the wall it's gonna

0:32:30.900,0:32:34.470
instantly move you back to where you

0:32:32.400,0:32:35.790
came from and it's gonna be so fast that

0:32:34.470,0:32:38.190
you're not gonna see it so we're gonna

0:32:35.790,0:32:40.770
put in a really short time delay just so

0:32:38.190,0:32:42.870
the user can see yeah I just hit a wall

0:32:40.770,0:32:46.190
right so we're gonna put in a really

0:32:42.870,0:32:49.500
short time delay so go to control and

0:32:46.190,0:32:50.670
the very bottom command nope it's not

0:32:49.500,0:32:55.950
the very bottom it's close to the bottom

0:32:50.670,0:32:59.730
is wait one seconds and what we're going

0:32:55.950,0:33:02.700
to do is we're going to wait just a very

0:32:59.730,0:33:05.400
small amount so I'm gonna wait point

0:33:02.700,0:33:08.460
zero five seconds and the reason I'm

0:33:05.400,0:33:10.620
doing that is because you have hit the

0:33:08.460,0:33:12.870
wall and I want the user to kind of

0:33:10.620,0:33:14.370
like see themselves inside the wall and

0:33:12.870,0:33:17.159
then I'm gonna move them back

0:33:14.370,0:33:20.279
now it doesn't matter whether it's at

0:33:17.159,0:33:22.350
the very top or whether it's after the

0:33:20.279,0:33:26.400
180 those don't matter but it does need

0:33:22.350,0:33:27.870
to be before the move 10 pixels all

0:33:26.400,0:33:28.650
right so we've got enough code that we

0:33:27.870,0:33:30.450
can try it

0:33:28.650,0:33:32.340
so Larry should always be checking to

0:33:30.450,0:33:34.260
see if he's hitting the wall if he is

0:33:32.340,0:33:37.409
hitting the wall he waits just a second

0:33:34.260,0:33:42.120
and then he backs it up so right now I

0:33:37.409,0:33:45.600
can give it a go so now whenever Larry

0:33:42.120,0:33:49.620
hits a wall he kind of bounces right now

0:33:45.600,0:33:51.929
if you want to try this during that half

0:33:49.620,0:33:53.789
second pause it is possible to keep

0:33:51.929,0:33:55.200
moving forwards so if you like really

0:33:53.789,0:33:58.380
go nuts you might be able to plow

0:33:55.200,0:34:01.649
through a wall yeah but that's a feature

0:33:58.380,0:34:04.320
that we just kind of hide from our users

0:34:01.649,0:34:05.460
so there are ways we can fix it but I'm

0:34:04.320,0:34:08.280
not worried about it but when you hit

0:34:05.460,0:34:10.500
the wall you bounce off but know that

0:34:08.280,0:34:12.240
as the creator of your game you can

0:34:10.500,0:34:13.679
plow through a wall if you do it hard

0:34:12.240,0:34:15.750
enough right you just have to hit the

0:34:13.679,0:34:18.330
button faster than point zero five

0:34:15.750,0:34:19.770
seconds all right going good I'm gonna

0:34:18.330,0:34:21.869
click on save just because I'm happy

0:34:19.770,0:34:26.010
about things now the next thing I want

0:34:21.869,0:34:28.530
to do is I want to lose the game if I

0:34:26.010,0:34:32.280
hit Moetato and I want to win the

0:34:28.530,0:34:36.619
game if I make it to Bob right so that's

0:34:32.280,0:34:39.060
my goal next so I need to always check

0:34:36.619,0:34:41.609
if those things are happening so I need

0:34:39.060,0:34:45.929
two more if statements so what I'm gonna

0:34:41.609,0:34:49.020
do is I'm still in LarryBoy I'm still in

0:34:45.929,0:34:52.560
my hero I'm gonna add two if statements

0:34:49.020,0:34:54.899
into my loop so total I'm checking for

0:34:52.560,0:34:57.630
three things am i touching a wall and if

0:34:54.899,0:35:01.290
so I want to bounce um am i touching

0:34:57.630,0:35:03.869
moetato because if so I lose and am i

0:35:01.290,0:35:05.430
touching Larry because if I if I am then

0:35:03.869,0:35:08.250
I win sorry am i touching Bob got the

0:35:05.430,0:35:12.270
wrong word there now this if statement

0:35:08.250,0:35:15.240
so if this condition then is not a color

0:35:12.270,0:35:19.680
we're actually looking for a sprite so

0:35:15.240,0:35:21.180
go into sensing now in the past we've

0:35:19.680,0:35:22.650
used touching color but that's not what

0:35:21.180,0:35:24.180
we're going to do this time we're going

0:35:22.650,0:35:26.369
to use this is crazy we're gonna use

0:35:24.180,0:35:27.599
touching mouse pointer and you're like

0:35:26.369,0:35:28.349
well that's weird why are you saying

0:35:27.599,0:35:30.390
touching Mouse

0:35:28.349,0:35:34.410
pointer and it's because you can change

0:35:30.390,0:35:35.819
mouse pointer to be someone else so you

0:35:34.410,0:35:38.339
have to decide which order you want to

0:35:35.819,0:35:42.329
do things maybe I'll do my villain first

0:35:38.339,0:35:47.970
so this is my lose first and then I'll

0:35:42.329,0:35:49.589
do touching Bob that's my win so do

0:35:47.970,0:35:51.630
yours in the same order of mine and that

0:35:49.589,0:35:54.720
way to be less confusing so do whatever

0:35:51.630,0:35:58.470
makes you lose first and then whatever

0:35:54.720,0:36:00.029
makes you win second so think about you

0:35:58.470,0:36:04.579
know your names of your actors over here

0:36:00.029,0:36:07.049
and lose first win second so if you lose

0:36:04.579,0:36:09.960
you've got to decide what do you what do

0:36:07.049,0:36:13.140
you want to happen you could make the

0:36:09.960,0:36:15.239
whole game end that would be fine or you

0:36:13.140,0:36:17.579
could just say something and move them back

0:36:15.239,0:36:19.380
to the start I think what I'm gonna do

0:36:17.579,0:36:21.450
and again this is a design choice that

0:36:19.380,0:36:24.359
you want is I'm just gonna move them

0:36:21.450,0:36:27.029
back to the start and then say something

0:36:24.359,0:36:29.849
that's like you lose try again or

0:36:27.029,0:36:31.170
something like that right alright so now

0:36:29.849,0:36:34.890
what I need to do is I need to know

0:36:31.170,0:36:37.259
where Larry is at the start right so he

0:36:34.890,0:36:38.910
is at a certain X&Y

0:36:37.259,0:36:41.819
so you need your pencil and your paper

0:36:38.910,0:36:44.400
again so move your hero to where they

0:36:41.819,0:36:48.359
start at and look to see what that

0:36:44.400,0:36:54.749
position is so for me it is negative 5 9

0:36:48.359,0:36:58.680
0 negative 2 7 9 hey that's almost my

0:36:54.749,0:36:59.430
phone number just teasing the next thing

0:36:58.680,0:37:05.579
you want to do is you want to go to

0:36:59.430,0:37:11.759
motion and you want to find a go to X Y

0:37:05.579,0:37:20.630
now it starts off with an X of 0 and a y

0:37:11.759,0:37:20.630
of 0 and you want to change that to your original starting numbers 

0:37:21.520,0:37:29.500
from before like that and so now if I touch moetato it will 

0:37:26.710,0:37:31.720
take me back to where I start the game if you

0:37:29.500,0:37:35.230
would like you could also have this

0:37:31.720,0:37:36.640
command at the start of your code this

0:37:35.230,0:37:38.070
is completely optional but if you click

0:37:36.640,0:37:41.560
on this handle you do a ctrl-c ctrl-v

0:37:38.070,0:37:43.180
you could if you wanted move this to

0:37:41.560,0:37:45.400
also be at the start of your code and

0:37:43.180,0:37:47.050
the only value for that is that if

0:37:45.400,0:37:49.290
somehow you kind of like mess up where

0:37:47.050,0:37:52.180
larry is at like during your development

0:37:49.290,0:37:53.620
even if I say to start him up here he's

0:37:52.180,0:37:56.140
gonna actually like go there when my

0:37:53.620,0:37:58.390
game starts so if you want you can have

0:37:56.140,0:38:00.610
that at the top not required but it

0:37:58.390,0:38:02.350
definitely needs to be here so what I'm

0:38:00.610,0:38:04.840
going to do is if I touch moetato I'm going

0:38:02.350,0:38:08.860
to zoom to that spot and then I'm gonna

0:38:04.840,0:38:10.150
say something saying something is in

0:38:08.860,0:38:12.400
looks right because we're gonna have a

0:38:10.150,0:38:18.160
speech bubble that pops up so I'm gonna

0:38:12.400,0:38:20.980
go to looks and I'm going to look for

0:38:18.160,0:38:26.710
the giant speech bubble here's a giant

0:38:20.980,0:38:32.980
speech bubble oops and I want to put it

0:38:26.710,0:38:42.760
right after the go to X Y and I'm gonna

0:38:32.980,0:38:44.650
say you lose play again and you can

0:38:42.760,0:38:46.420
choose to say this however you want to

0:38:44.650,0:38:48.010
say it if you want it to appear as

0:38:46.420,0:38:50.800
though Larry is saying it you could use

0:38:48.010,0:38:53.020
a rectangular speech bubble you could

0:38:50.800,0:38:55.060
use a top message a bottom message a

0:38:53.020,0:38:56.590
centered message it doesn't matter just

0:38:55.060,0:38:58.480
because it's something I haven't ever

0:38:56.590,0:39:00.580
tried before I'm gonna say a message

0:38:58.480,0:39:04.390
right in the center of the screen and

0:39:00.580,0:39:08.440
I'm gonna make it huge 48 it's pretty

0:39:04.390,0:39:10.420
huge alright maybe 36 is plenty now this

0:39:08.440,0:39:13.210
is going to be pretty easy to test we

0:39:10.420,0:39:14.530
just need to run into our villain and if

0:39:13.210,0:39:17.110
we run into our villain it's just gonna

0:39:14.530,0:39:21.070
warp us back to here and then it's gonna

0:39:17.110,0:39:21.490
say you lose play again so go ahead and

0:39:21.070,0:39:23.560
try it

0:39:21.490,0:39:26.170
so get your hero to where you think

0:39:23.560,0:39:29.170
they're going to be in trouble and then

0:39:26.170,0:39:32.500
whenever it hits it mine set in giant

0:39:29.170,0:39:35.500
letters you lose play again cool so I

0:39:32.500,0:39:38.830
can try that one more time

0:39:35.500,0:39:41.140
maybe I'll make it bigger so I've got to

0:39:38.830,0:39:42.370
wait for my villain to finish his loop

0:39:41.140,0:39:44.440
so that he can get back over here I've

0:39:42.370,0:39:46.390
got to memorize how my villain moves so

0:39:44.440,0:39:48.910
I can actually win my game but when he

0:39:46.390,0:39:52.810
hits him it says you lose play again I'm

0:39:48.910,0:39:53.590
pretty happy with that so the nice thing

0:39:52.810,0:39:56.040
is

0:39:53.590,0:39:56.040
oops

0:39:56.620,0:40:01.240
I did something silly I almost exited my

0:39:58.780,0:40:03.610
whole game so the nice thing is is that

0:40:01.240,0:40:07.240
we're almost there right so if we hit

0:40:03.610,0:40:09.730
moetato we lose and we're going to let

0:40:07.240,0:40:11.320
people keep playing and so now the only

0:40:09.730,0:40:14.950
thing we need to do is what do we want

0:40:11.320,0:40:18.130
to have happen if we want to hit Bob so

0:40:14.950,0:40:23.710
hitting Bob so one thing we want to do

0:40:18.130,0:40:28.060
is we want to say you win right so if

0:40:23.710,0:40:34.090
you win we want to go to looks find a

0:40:28.060,0:40:41.410
giant text bubble and we want to say you

0:40:34.090,0:40:43.510
win and again you could have it look

0:40:41.410,0:40:45.100
like Larry saying it you could have it

0:40:43.510,0:40:46.960
show up on the screen whatever you want

0:40:45.100,0:40:48.790
to do just for giggles I'm gonna have it

0:40:46.960,0:40:50.350
look like Larry saying it you could also

0:40:48.790,0:40:52.480
do things like change the background

0:40:50.350,0:40:55.390
color the font color whatever you want

0:40:52.480,0:40:59.170
to do to try your game now once we hit

0:40:55.390,0:41:00.640
Larry and it says you win we've got to

0:40:59.170,0:41:04.090
decide what we want to happen in that

0:41:00.640,0:41:05.410
case as well so one of the enhancements

0:41:04.090,0:41:07.390
I'm gonna encourage you to make is to

0:41:05.410,0:41:08.800
make a different like maze I'm not going

0:41:07.390,0:41:10.690
to show that but I'm gonna have you like

0:41:08.800,0:41:13.990
move to some spot and then like show the

0:41:10.690,0:41:16.870
next maze right but for now we just need

0:41:13.990,0:41:17.980
to decide what we want to do so you can

0:41:16.870,0:41:20.920
do whatever you'd like

0:41:17.980,0:41:24.130
maybe maybe what you want to do is you

0:41:20.920,0:41:26.290
just want to go back to the start after

0:41:24.130,0:41:27.790
they finish talking and then they could

0:41:26.290,0:41:30.100
just play again if they wanted for now

0:41:27.790,0:41:33.250
so I think that that is is good enough

0:41:30.100,0:41:34.930
for me there is no right answer this is

0:41:33.250,0:41:37.570
your game there is no single right

0:41:34.930,0:41:39.910
answer but I do want to test it and see

0:41:37.570,0:41:43.570
if it works now one way to test it is to

0:41:39.910,0:41:46.000
actually like get to that spot there's

0:41:43.570,0:41:47.680
nothing wrong with that but sometimes

0:41:46.000,0:41:49.280
the best way to test your game is to

0:41:47.680,0:41:51.590
cheat and to figure up how 

0:41:49.280,0:41:54.050
how to cheat to make testing easier

0:41:51.590,0:41:56.630
right so I want to test this without

0:41:54.050,0:41:58.640
going to a lot of work so it would be

0:41:56.630,0:42:01.130
really easy to win if Larry started

0:41:58.640,0:42:03.080
right there right so here's what I'm

0:42:01.130,0:42:12.380
gonna do to cheat is I'm gonna write

0:42:03.080,0:42:14.060
down my cheater spot so my cheater spot is 280 189 so my

0:42:12.380,0:42:15.860
code may or may not work I don't even

0:42:14.060,0:42:18.170
know yet I haven't tested it and in

0:42:15.860,0:42:21.410
order to test it I'm gonna cheat so I've

0:42:18.170,0:42:24.200
got my cheater spot and here's what I'm

0:42:21.410,0:42:28.040
gonna do I'm gonna add some code that I

0:42:24.200,0:42:30.740
know I'm gonna take out later and I'm

0:42:28.040,0:42:32.750
going to add my cheater code just before

0:42:30.740,0:42:36.950
my forever loop I'm gonna go to my

0:42:32.750,0:42:41.270
cheater spot cheating is good for

0:42:36.950,0:42:42.980
testing right so now this this line

0:42:41.270,0:42:44.600
of code I'm gonna have to remember to

0:42:42.980,0:42:47.180
take it out before I ship/publish my game

0:42:44.600,0:42:49.460
because it's just for a test but now

0:42:47.180,0:42:53.060
when I hit play Larry goes immediately

0:42:49.460,0:42:57.350
to my cheater spot and I step over and I

0:42:53.060,0:43:01.970
say you win so that is how you develop a

0:42:57.350,0:43:03.530
game by cheating right it looked like it

0:43:01.970,0:43:06.590
worked perfectly to me I just step right

0:43:03.530,0:43:09.920
over and hit Larry and I won so now I'm

0:43:06.590,0:43:12.860
ready to delete my cheater code to

0:43:09.920,0:43:15.590
delete just that line you grab the right

0:43:12.860,0:43:19.340
handle and you drag it out of the game

0:43:15.590,0:43:22.640
so there I just drug it out so now I

0:43:19.340,0:43:25.550
think my game is is ready to go so now

0:43:22.640,0:43:27.050
I'm gonna give it one full test so it

0:43:25.550,0:43:30.080
might take me a little while to win my

0:43:27.050,0:43:32.000
game so moetato goes over and so I use

0:43:30.080,0:43:36.350
this opportunity to kind of like get

0:43:32.000,0:43:38.870
around and then moetato goes down and

0:43:36.350,0:43:40.790
that way now I happen to know that

0:43:38.870,0:43:43.250
moetato is gonna spend a lot of time over

0:43:40.790,0:43:44.180
there so I'm gonna just hang out right

0:43:43.250,0:43:46.250
here for a second

0:43:44.180,0:43:52.190
until moetato has passed me now I'm

0:43:46.250,0:43:52.700
gonna make my run for it Bob oh all

0:43:52.190,0:43:54.980
right

0:43:52.700,0:43:57.440
so try your game out as well see if

0:43:54.980,0:43:59.510
yours is playable and winnable but I

0:43:57.440,0:44:01.640
think that I have mine to where I can

0:43:59.510,0:44:03.369
win so it says you win and it snaps me

0:44:01.640,0:44:07.250
back to there

0:44:03.369,0:44:08.780
great so for me mine is done I might

0:44:07.250,0:44:10.609
have to give my campers just a minute to

0:44:08.780,0:44:14.690
finish theirs but I'm gonna go ahead and

0:44:10.609,0:44:16.070
hit save and publish and I'm also going

0:44:14.690,0:44:17.390
to tell you so I'm gonna get my campers

0:44:16.070,0:44:19.790
a minute to finish theirs then I'll help

0:44:17.390,0:44:21.590
them out I'm also going to tell you what

0:44:19.790,0:44:23.480
I think some fun enhancements are to

0:44:21.590,0:44:26.300
this game so one enhancement that I

0:44:23.480,0:44:28.730
think is fun is to make a second

0:44:26.300,0:44:30.440
background like a second maze right and

0:44:28.730,0:44:32.150
the way you can do that I'll just kind

0:44:30.440,0:44:35.000
of say enough to get you started is you

0:44:32.150,0:44:38.570
go into the costumes you say add

0:44:35.000,0:44:41.480
background you make a new background

0:44:38.570,0:44:47.570
right so maybe I have a new background

0:44:41.480,0:44:49.520
like this and then when you win you go

0:44:47.570,0:44:51.890
back to here I'm doing this fast because

0:44:49.520,0:44:53.680
this is an optional thing right you

0:44:51.890,0:44:59.810
could actually switch to the next

0:44:53.680,0:45:00.950
background and so now just to show it

0:44:59.810,0:45:05.060
faster I'm going to put back in my

0:45:00.950,0:45:08.660
cheater cheater code and so now when I

0:45:05.060,0:45:10.040
when you win it'll say you win and then

0:45:08.660,0:45:13.100
it'll start you on the next level right

0:45:10.040,0:45:14.450
oh this level was really hard no way I'm

0:45:13.100,0:45:16.520
getting through there actually that

0:45:14.450,0:45:19.940
color is not my maze color so I can just

0:45:16.520,0:45:23.359
walk right through it hey yay and then

0:45:19.940,0:45:24.859
if I win this level it says you win and

0:45:23.359,0:45:26.960
then it takes me to the next level

0:45:24.859,0:45:29.690
and so you can make as many different

0:45:26.960,0:45:31.340
levels as you would like but to make it

0:45:29.690,0:45:31.910
fun you do have to use that same maze

0:45:31.340,0:45:33.680
color

0:45:31.910,0:45:35.300
so that's just one enhancement that you

0:45:33.680,0:45:36.980
can make if you wanted to make your game

0:45:35.300,0:45:38.720
better another thing you could do to

0:45:36.980,0:45:41.540
make your game better is you could add

0:45:38.720,0:45:43.880
sounds people love sounds but when you

0:45:41.540,0:45:46.730
win you could play a sound when you hit

0:45:43.880,0:45:48.200
a wall you could play a sound just to

0:45:46.730,0:45:52.190
kind of show how to add one sound

0:45:48.200,0:45:55.250
maybe I'll go into LarryBoy I'm gonna

0:45:52.190,0:45:58.850
click on LarryBoy's gear go to sounds

0:45:55.250,0:46:01.340
and say add sounds and maybe there's

0:45:58.850,0:46:05.210
like a blink or something like that like

0:46:01.340,0:46:09.530
a boing yeah there's a Boing and so for

0:46:05.210,0:46:12.710
Larry maybe if he touches the wall I'll

0:46:09.530,0:46:17.930
make him go boing right and so I'm gonna

0:46:12.710,0:46:20.630
go sound play sound until done

0:46:17.930,0:46:23.510
maybe I'll play it right there so any

0:46:20.630,0:46:27.019
time Larry hits a wall he's got to go

0:46:23.510,0:46:30.950
boing right and so just kind of an

0:46:27.019,0:46:33.109
added little feature so I am

0:46:30.950,0:46:36.049
intentionally not showing you everything

0:46:33.109,0:46:39.500
you could do because that's kind of what

0:46:36.049,0:46:43.490
makes the game fun right oh I just realized

0:46:39.500,0:46:44.960
I should play the boing after I move

0:46:43.490,0:46:46.880
him back right because I have play

0:46:44.960,0:46:49.670
boing until done another thing you can

0:46:46.880,0:46:52.119
do by the way is play until done pauses

0:46:49.670,0:46:56.269
everything you could also just play it

0:46:52.119,0:46:58.549
without waiting for it to finish alright

0:46:56.269,0:47:01.220
so I think that the mine is ready to go

0:46:58.549,0:47:03.740
I'm curious to see how my campers fared

0:47:01.220,0:47:06.680
today campers are you ready for me to

0:47:03.740,0:47:09.440
see how you guys did today kind of

0:47:06.680,0:47:11.510
that's what we got today I'm sure that

0:47:09.440,0:47:15.769
we can fix it as we go so Keegan how's

0:47:11.510,0:47:18.710
the the minion project coming along so

0:47:15.769,0:47:20.660
you made your speed very fast and being

0:47:18.710,0:47:24.980
very fast you've got a couple a couple

0:47:20.660,0:47:26.210
minor bugs so by being so fast you can

0:47:24.980,0:47:28.609
kind of walk through some of your walls

0:47:26.210,0:47:30.710
I'll tell you what oh and you're just

0:47:28.609,0:47:33.369
holding down the movement oh so 

0:47:30.710,0:47:35.390
you're like blitzing through things

0:47:33.369,0:47:37.250
looks great buddy did you have fun

0:47:35.390,0:47:40.819
building that do you have ideas for

0:47:51.440,0:47:59.569
the the PJ Masks reference so gecko has

0:47:56.269,0:48:01.970
to try to get through his maze nice one

0:47:59.569,0:48:04.009
gecko and he's trying to get over to the

0:48:01.970,0:48:07.869
little gecko whoa you went the low route

0:48:04.009,0:48:10.640
was that a is that a design choice there Bowen

0:48:07.869,0:48:14.119
you got the makings of a web designer or

0:48:10.640,0:48:16.130
a game designer you win hey Bowen was

0:48:14.119,0:48:18.970
that pretty awesome yeah did you have

0:48:16.130,0:48:20.880
fun today are you able to speak

0:48:18.970,0:48:23.400
[Laughter]

0:48:20.880,0:48:27.000
all right let's check out McKinley's alright

0:48:23.400,0:48:29.550
McKinley what have you got so you've got

0:48:27.000,0:48:32.820
the horse and the horse is getting

0:48:29.550,0:48:34.830
through her elaborate maze McKinley made

0:48:32.820,0:48:36.150
fun of me because my maze was so easy

0:48:34.830,0:48:39.600
hey you walked right through the wall

0:48:36.150,0:48:41.520
cheaters cheaters never win so if you do

0:48:39.600,0:48:45.180
have a problem with lots of cheaters in

0:48:41.520,0:48:48.630
your game take out that that delay of

0:48:45.180,0:48:52.080
point zero five seconds and that's gonna

0:48:48.630,0:48:55.020
stop a bunch of cheating so you can you

0:48:52.080,0:48:57.030
can decide you're the game designer you

0:48:55.020,0:48:59.580
can decide how you feel about cheating

0:48:57.030,0:49:02.160
but if you wanted to prevent some of

0:48:59.580,0:49:06.990
that walking through walls nonsense take

0:49:02.160,0:49:09.870
that command out and they won't get the

0:49:06.990,0:49:12.330
feedback why they can't go through the

0:49:09.870,0:49:13.500
walls they'll just hit the wall and it

0:49:12.330,0:49:15.570
just like they just won't be able to

0:49:13.500,0:49:19.020
move but that will prevent the cheating

0:49:15.570,0:49:21.870
that happens right maybe a sound effect

0:49:19.020,0:49:24.150
is better than a visual right all right

0:49:21.870,0:49:26.700
so we hope you enjoyed today I know I

0:49:24.150,0:49:28.710
